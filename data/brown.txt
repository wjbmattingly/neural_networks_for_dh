as the ancient cogwheel train clawed its way up the dizzying incline, Edmond Kirsch surveyed the jagged mountaintop above him. In the distance, built into the face of a sheer cliff, the massive stone monastery seemed to hang in space, as if magically fused to the vertical precipice. This timeless sanctuary in Catalonia, Spain, had endured the relentless pull of gravity for more than four centuries, never slipping from its original purpose: to insulate its occupants from the modern world. Ironically, they will now be the first to learn the truth, Kirsch thought, wondering how they would react. Historically, the most dangerous men on earth were men of God ... especially when their gods became threatened. And I am about to hurl a flaming spear into a hornets' nest. When the train reached the mountaintop, Kirsch saw a solitary figure waiting for him on the platform. The wizened skeleton of a man was draped in the traditional Catholic purple cassock and white rochet, with a zucchetto on his head. Kirsch recognized his host's rawboned features from photos and felt an unexpected surge of adrenaline. Valdespino is greeting me personally. Bishop Antonio Valdespino was a formidable figure in Spain�not only a trusted friend and counselor to the king himself, but one of the country's most vocal and influential advocates for the preservation of conservative Catholic values and traditional political standards. "Edmond Kirsch, I assume?" the bishop intoned as Kirsch exited the train. "Guilty as charged," Kirsch said, smiling as he reached out to shake his host's bony hand. "Bishop Valdespino, I want to thank you for arranging this meeting." "I appreciate your requesting it." The bishop's voice was stronger than Kirsch expected�clear and penetrating, like a bell. "It is not often we are consulted by men of science, especially one of your prominence. This way, please." As Valdespino guided Kirsch across the platform, the cold mountain air whipped at the bishop's cassock. "I must confess," Valdespino said, "you look different than I imagined. I was expecting a scientist, but you're quite ..." He eyed his guest's sleek Kiton K50 suit and Barker ostrich shoes with a hint of disdain. "'Hip,' I believe, is the word?" Kirsch smiled politely. The word "hip" went out of style decades ago. "In reading your list of accomplishments," the bishop said, "I am still not entirely sure what it is you do." "I specialize in game theory and computer modeling." "So you make the computer games that the children play?" Kirsch sensed the bishop was feigning ignorance in an attempt to be quaint. More accurately, Kirsch knew, Valdespino was a frighteningly well-informed student of technology and often warned others of its dangers. "No, sir, actually game theory is a field of mathematics that studies patterns in order to make predictions about the future." "Ah yes. I believe I read that you predicted a European monetary crisis some years ago? When nobody listened, you saved the day by inventing a computer program that pulled the EU back from the dead. What was your famous quote? �At thirty-three years old, I am the same age as Christ when He performed His resurrection.'" Kirsch cringed. "A poor analogy, Your Grace. I was young." "Young?" The bishop chuckled. "And how old are you now ... perhaps forty?" "Just." The old man smiled as the strong wind continued to billow his robe. "Well, the meek were supposed to inherit the earth, but instead it has gone to the young �the technically inclined, those who stare into video screens rather than into their own souls. I must admit, I never imagined I would have reason to meet the young man leading the charge. They call you a prophet, you know." "Not a very good one in your case, Your Grace," Kirsch replied. "When I asked if I might meet you and your colleagues privately, I calculated only a twenty percent chance you would accept." "And as I told my colleagues, the devout can always benefit from listening to nonbelievers. It is in hearing the voice of the devil that we can better appreciate the voice of God." The old man smiled. "I am joking, of course. Please forgive my aging sense of humor. My filters fail me from time to time." With that, Bishop Valdespino motioned ahead. "The others are waiting. This way, please." Kirsch eyed their destination, a colossal citadel of gray stone perched on the edge of a sheer cliff that plunged thousands of feet down into a lush tapestry of wooded foothills. Unnerved by the height, Kirsch averted his eyes from the chasm and followed the bishop along the uneven cliffside path, turning his thoughts to the meeting ahead. Kirsch had requested an audience with three prominent religious leaders who had just finished attending a conference here. The Parliament of the World's Religions. Since 1893, hundreds of spiritual leaders from nearly thirty world religions had gathered in a different location every few years to spend a week engaged in interfaith dialogue. Participants included a wide array of influential Christian priests, Jewish rabbis, and Islamic mullahs from around the world, along with Hindu pujaris, Buddhist bhikkhus, Jains, Sikhs, and others. The parliament's self-proclaimed objective was "to cultivate harmony among the world's religions, build bridges between diverse spiritualities, and celebrate the intersections of all faith." A noble quest, Kirsch thought, despite seeing it as an empty exercise�a meaningless search for random points of correspondence among a hodgepodge of ancient fictions, fables, and myths. As Bishop Valdespino guided him along the pathway, Kirsch peered down the mountainside with a sardonic thought. Moses climbed a mountain to accept the Word ofGod... and I have climbed a mountain to do quite the opposite. Kirsch's motivation for climbing this mountain, he had told himself, was one of ethical obligation, but he knew there was a good dose of hubris fueling this visit�he was eager to feel the gratification of sitting face-to-face with these clerics and foretelling their imminent demise. You've had your run at defining our truth. "I looked at your curriculum vitae," the bishop said abruptly, glancing at Kirsch. "I see you're a product of Harvard University?" "Undergraduate. Yes." "I see. Recently, I read that for the first time in Harvard's history, the incoming student body consists of more atheists and agnostics than those who identify as followers of any religion. That is quite a telling statistic, Mr. Kirsch." What can I tell you, Kirsch wanted to reply, our students keep getting smarter. The wind whipped harder as they arrived at the ancient stone edifice. Inside the dim light of the building's entryway, the air was heavy with the thick fragrance of burning frankincense. The two men snaked through a maze of dark corridors, and Kirsch's eyes fought to adjust as he followed his cloaked host. Finally, they arrived at an unusually small wooden door. The bishop knocked, ducked down, and entered, motioning for his guest to follow. Uncertain, Kirsch stepped over the threshold. He found himself in a rectangular chamber whose high walls burgeoned with ancient leather-bound tomes. Additional freestanding bookshelves jutted out of the walls like ribs, interspersed with cast-iron radiators that clanged and hissed, giving the room the eerie sense that it was alive. Kirsch raised his eyes to the ornately balustraded walkway that encircled the second story and knew without a doubt where he was. The famed library of Montserrat, he realized, startled to have been admitted. This sacred room was rumored to contain uniquely rare texts accessible only to those monks who had devoted their lives to God and who were sequestered here on this mountain. "You asked for discretion," the bishop said. "This is our most private space. Few outsiders have ever entered." "A generous privilege. Thank you." Kirsch followed the bishop to a large wooden table where two elderly men sat waiting. The man on the left looked timeworn, with tired eyes and a matted white beard. He wore a crumpled black suit, white shirt, and fedora. "This is Rabbi Yehuda Koves," the bishop said. "He is a prominent Jewish philosopher who has written extensively on Kabbalistic cosmology." Kirsch reached across the table and politely shook hands with Rabbi Koves. "A pleasure to meet you, sir," Kirsch said. "I've read your books on Kabbala. I can't say I understood them, but I've read them." Koves gave an amiable nod, dabbing at his watery eyes with his handkerchief. "And here," the bishop continued, motioning to the other man, "you have the respected allamah, Syed al-Fadl." The revered Islamic scholar stood up and smiled broadly. He was short and squat with a jovial face that seemed a mismatch with his dark penetrating eyes. He was dressed in an unassuming white thaxvb. "And, Mr. Kirsch, I have read your predictions on the future of mankind. I can't say I agree with them, but I have read them." Kirsch gave a gracious smile and shook the man's hand. "And our guest, Edmond Kirsch," the bishop concluded, addressing his two colleagues, "as you know, is a highly regarded computer scientist, game theorist, inventor, and something of a prophet in the technological world. Considering his background, I was puzzled by his request to address the three of us. Therefore, I shall now leave it to Mr. Kirsch to explain why he has come." With that, Bishop Valdespino took a seat between his two colleagues, folded his hands, and gazed up expectantly at Kirsch. All three men faced him like a tribunal, creating an ambience more like that of an inquisition than a friendly meeting of scholars. The bishop, Kirsch now realized, had not even set out a chair for him. Kirsch felt more bemused than intimidated as he studied the three aging men before him. So this is the Holy Trinity I requested. The Three Wise Men. Pausing a moment to assert his power, Kirsch walked over to the window and gazed out at the breathtaking panorama below. A sunlit patchwork of ancient pastoral lands stretched across a deep valley, giving way to the rugged peaks of the Collserola mountain range. Miles beyond, somewhere out over the Balearic Sea, a menacing bank of storm clouds was now gathering on the horizon. Fitting, Kirsch thought, sensing the turbulence he would soon cause in this room, and in the world beyond. "Gentlemen," he commenced, turning abruptly back toward them. "I believe Bishop Valdespino has already conveyed to you my request for secrecy. Before we continue, I just want to clarify that what I am about to share with you must be kept in the strictest confidence. Simply stated, I am asking for a vow of silence from all of you. Are we in agreement?" All three men gave nods of tacit acquiescence, which Kirsch knew were probably redundant anyway. They will want to bury this information�not broadcast it. "I am here today," Kirsch began, "because I have made a scientific discovery I believe you will find startling. It is something I have pursued for many years, hoping to provide answers to two of the most fundamental questions of our human experience. Now that I have succeeded, I have come to you specifically because I believe this information will affect the world's faithful in a profound way, quite possibly causing a shift that can only be described as, shall we say� disruptive. At the moment, I am the only person on earth who has the information I am about to reveal to you." Kirsch reached into his suit coat and pulled out an oversized smartphone�one that he had designed and built to serve his own unique needs. The phone had a vibrantly colored mosaic case, and he propped it up before the three men like a television. In a moment, he would use the device to dial into an ultrasecure server, enter his forty-seven-character password, and live-stream a presentation for them. "What you are about to see," Kirsch said, "is a rough cut of an announcement I hope to share with the world�perhaps in a month or so. But before I do, I wanted to consult with a few of the world's most influential religious thinkers, to gain insight into how this news will be received by those it affects most." The bishop sighed loudly, sounding more bored than concerned. "An intriguing preamble, Mr. Kirsch. You speak as if whatever you are about to show us will shake the foundations of the world's religions." Kirsch glanced around the ancient repository of sacred texts. It will not shake your foundations. It will shatter them. Kirsch appraised the men before him. What they did not know was that in only three days' time, Kirsch planned to go public with this presentation in a stunning, meticulously choreographed event. When he did, people across the world would realize that the teachings of all religions did indeed have one thing in common. They were all dead wrong. CHAPTER 1 professor Robert langdon gazed up at the forty-foot-tall dog sitting in the plaza. The animal's fur was a living carpet of grass and fragrant flowers. I'm trying to love you, he thought. I truly am. Langdon pondered the creature a bit longer and then continued along a suspended walkway, descending a sprawling terrace of stairs whose uneven treads were intended to jar the arriving visitor from his usual rhythm and gait. Mission accomplished, Langdon decided, nearly stumbling twice on the irregular steps. At the bottom of the stairs, Langdon jolted to a stop, staring at a massive object that loomed ahead. Now I've seen it all. A towering black widow spider rose before him, its slender iron legs supporting a bulbous body at least thirty feet in the air. On the spider's underbelly hung a wire-mesh egg sac filled with glass orbs. "Her name is Maman," a voice said. Langdon lowered his gaze and saw a slender man standing beneath the spider. He wore a black brocade sherwani and had an almost comical curling Salvador Dali mustache. "My name is Fernando," he continued, "and I'm here to welcome you to the museum." The man perused a collection of name tags on a table before him. "May I have your name, please?" "Certainly. Robert Langdon." The man's eyes shot back up. "Ah, I am so sorry! I did not recognize you, sir!" I barely recognize myself, Langdon thought, advancing stiffly in his white bow tie, black tails, and white waistcoat. I look like a Whiffenpoof. Langdon's classic tails were almost thirty years old, preserved from his days as a member of the Ivy Club at Princeton, but thanks to his faithful daily regimen of swimming laps, the outfit still fit him fairly well. In Langdon's haste to pack, he had grabbed the wrong hanging bag from his closet, leaving his usual tuxedo behind. "The invitation said black and white," Langdon said. "I trust tails are appropriate?" "Tails are a classic! You look dashing!" The man scurried over and carefully pressed a name tag to the lapel of Langdon's jacket. "It's an honor to meet you, sir," the mustached man said. "No doubt you've visited us before?" Langdon gazed through the spider's legs at the glistening building before them. "Actually, I'm embarrassed to say, I've never been." "No!" The man feigned falling over. "You're not a fan of modern art?" Langdon had always enjoyed the challenge of modern art�primarily the exploration of why particular works were hailed as masterpieces: Jackson Pollock's drip paintings; Andy Warhol's Campbell's Soup cans; Mark Rothko's simple rectangles of color. Even so, Langdon was far more comfortable discussing the religious symbolism of Hieronymus Bosch or the brushwork of Francisco de Goya. "I'm more of a classicist," Langdon replied. "I do better with da Vinci than with de Kooning." "But da Vinci and de Kooning are so similar !" Langdon smiled patiently. "Then I clearly have a bit to learn about de Kooning." "Well, you've come to the right place!" The man swung his arm toward the massive building. "In this museum, you will find one of the finest collections of modern art on earth! I do hope you enjoy." "I intend to," Langdon replied. "I only wish I knew why I'm here." "You and everyone else!" The man laughed merrily, shaking his head. "Your host has been very secretive about the purpose of tonight's event. Not even the museum staff knows what's happening. The mystery is half the fun of it�rumors are running wild! There are several hundred guests inside�many famous faces �and nobody has any idea what's on the agenda tonight!" Now Langdon grinned. Very few hosts on earth would have the bravado to send out last-minute invitations that essentially read: Saturday night. Be there. Trust me. And even fewer would be able to persuade hundreds of VIPs to drop everything and fly to northern Spain to attend the event. Langdon walked out from beneath the spider and continued along the pathway, glancing up at an enormous red banner that billowed overhead. AN EVENING WITH EDMOND KIRSCH Edmond has certainly never lacked confidence, Langdon thought, amused. Some twenty years ago, young Eddie Kirsch had been one of Langdon's first students at Harvard University�a mop-haired computer geek whose interest in codes had led him to Langdon's freshman seminar: Codes, Ciphers, and the Language of Symbols. The sophistication of Kirsch's intellect had impressed Langdon deeply, and although Kirsch eventually abandoned the dusty world of semiotics for the shining promise of computers, he and Langdon had developed a student-teacher bond that had kept them in contact over the past two decades since Kirsch's graduation. Now the student has surpassed his teacher, Langdon thought. By several light- years. Today, Edmond Kirsch was a world-renowned maverick�a billionaire computer scientist, futurist, inventor, and entrepreneur. The forty-year-old had fathered an astounding array of advanced technologies that represented major leaps forward in fields as diverse as robotics, brain science, artificial intelligence, and nanotechnology. And his accurate predictions about future scientific breakthroughs had created a mystical aura around the man. Langdon suspected that Edmond's eerie knack for prognostication stemmed from his astoundingly broad knowledge of the world around him. Lor as long as Langdon could remember, Edmond had been an insatiable bibliophile�reading everything in sight. The man's passion for books, and his capacity for absorbing their contents, surpassed anything Langdon had ever witnessed. Lor the past few years, Kirsch had lived primarily in Spain, attributing his choice to an ongoing love affair with the country's old-world charm, avant-garde architecture, eccentric gin bars, and perfect weather. Once a year, when Kirsch returned to Cambridge to speak at the MIT Media Lab, Langdon would join him for a meal at one of the trendy new Boston hot spots that Langdon had never heard of. Their conversations were never about technology; all Kirsch ever wanted to discuss with Langdon was the arts. "You're my culture connection, Robert," Kirsch often joked. "My own private bachelor of arts! " The playful jab at Langdon's marital status was particularly ironic coming from a fellow bachelor who denounced monogamy as "an affront to evolution" and had been photographed with a wide range of supermodels over the years. Considering Kirsch's reputation as an innovator in computer science, one could easily have imagined him being a buttoned-up techno-nerd. But he had instead fashioned himself into a modern pop icon who moved in celebrity circles, dressed in the latest styles, listened to arcane underground music, and collected a wide array of priceless Impressionist and modern art. Kirsch often e- mailed Langdon to get his advice on new pieces of art he was considering for his collection. And then he would do the exact opposite, Langdon mused. About a year ago, Kirsch had surprised Langdon by asking him not about art, but about God�an odd topic for a self-proclaimed atheist. Over a plate of short- rib crudo at Boston's Tiger Mama, Kirsch had picked Langdon's brain on the core beliefs of various world religions, in particular their different stories of the Creation. Langdon gave him a solid overview of current beliefs, from the Genesis story shared by Judaism, Christianity, and Islam, all the way through the Hindu story of Brahma, the Babylonian tale of Marduk, and others. "I'm curious," Langdon asked as they left the restaurant. "Why is a futurist so interested in the past? Does this mean our famous atheist has finally found God?" Edmond let out a hearty laugh. "Wishful thinking! I'm just sizing up my competition, Robert." Langdon smiled. Typical. "Well, science and religion are not competitors, they're two different languages trying to tell the same story. There's room in this world for both." After that meeting, Edmond had dropped out of contact for almost a year. And then, out of the blue, three days ago, Langdon had received a FedEx envelope with a plane ticket, a hotel reservation, and a handwritten note from Edmond urging him to attend tonight's event. It read: Robert, it would mean the world to me if you of all people could attend. Your insights during our last conversation helped make this night possible. Langdon was baffled. Nothing about that conversation seemed remotely relevant to an event that would be hosted by a futurist. The FedEx envelope also included a black-and-white image of two people standing face-to-face. Kirsch had written a short poem to Langdon. Robert, When you see me face-to-face, I'll reveal the empty space. �Edmond Langdon smiled when he saw the image�a clever allusion to an episode in which Langdon had been involved several years earlier. The silhouette of a chalice, or Grail cup, revealed itself in the empty space between the two faces. Now Langdon stood outside this museum, eager to learn what his former student was about to announce. A light breeze ruffled his jacket tails as he moved along the cement walkway on the bank of the meandering Nervion River, which had once been the lifeblood of a thriving industrial city. The air smelled vaguely of copper. As Langdon rounded a bend in the pathway, he finally permitted himself to look at the massive, glimmering museum. The structure was impossible to take in at a glance. Instead, his gaze traced back and forth along the entire length of the bizarre, elongated forms. This building doesn't just break the rules, Langdon thought. It ignores them completely. A perfect spot for Edmond. The Guggenheim Museum in Bilbao, Spain, looked like something out of an alien hallucination�a swirling collage of warped metallic forms that appeared to have been propped up against one another in an almost random way. Stretching into the distance, the chaotic mass of shapes was draped in more than thirty thousand titanium tiles that glinted like fish scales and gave the structure a simultaneously organic and extraterrestrial feel, as if some futuristic leviathan had crawled out of the water to sun herself on the riverbank. When the building was first unveiled in 1997, The New Yorker hailed its architect, Frank Gehry, as having designed "a fantastic dream ship of undulating form in a cloak of titanium," while other critics around the world gushed, "The greatest building of our time!" "Mercurial brilliance!" "An astonishing architectural feat!" Since the museum's debut, dozens of other "deconstructivist" buildings had been erected�the Disney Concert Hall in Los Angeles, BMW World in Munich, and even the new library at Langdon's own alma mater. Each featured radically unconventional design and construction, and yet Langdon doubted any of them could compete with the Bilbao Guggenheim for its sheer shock value. As Langdon approached, the tiled facade seemed to morph with each step, offering a fresh personality from every angle. The museum's most dramatic illusion now became visible. Incredibly, from this perspective, the colossal structure appeared to be quite literally floating on water, adrift on a vast "infinity" lagoon that lapped against the museum's outer walls. Langdon paused a moment to marvel at the effect and then set out to cross the lagoon via the minimalist footbridge that arched over the glassy expanse of water. He was only halfway across when a loud hissing noise startled him. It was emanating from beneath his feet. He stopped short just as a swirling cloud of mist began billowing out from beneath the walkway. The thick veil of fog rose around him and then tumbled outward across the lagoon, rolling toward the museum and engulfing the base of the entire structure. The Fog Sculpture, Langdon thought. He had read about this work by Japanese artist Fujiko Nakaya. The "sculpture" was revolutionary in that it was constructed out of the medium of visible air, a wall of fog that materialized and dissipated over time; and because the breezes and atmospheric conditions were never identical one day to the next, the sculpture was different every time it appeared. The bridge stopped hissing, and Langdon watched the wall of fog settle silently across the lagoon, swirling and creeping as if it had a mind of its own. The effect was both ethereal and disorienting. The entire museum now appeared to be hovering over the water, resting weightlessly on a cloud�a ghost ship lost at sea. Just as Langdon was about to set out again, the tranquil surface of the water was shattered by a series of small eruptions. Suddenly five flaming pillars of fire shot skyward out of the lagoon, thundering steadily like rocket engines that pierced the mist-laden air and threw brilliant bursts of light across the museum's titanium tiles. Langdon's own architectural taste tended more to the classical stylings of museums like the Louvre or the Prado, and yet as he watched the fog and flame hover above the lagoon, he could think of no place more suitable than this ultramodern museum to host an event thrown by a man who loved art and innovation, and who glimpsed the future so clearly. Now, walking through the mist, Langdon pressed on to the museum's entrance �an ominous black hole in the reptilian structure. As he neared the threshold, Langdon had the uneasy sense that he was entering the mouth of a dragon. CHAPTER 2 navy admiral luis Avila was seated on a bar stool inside a deserted pub in an unfamiliar town. He was drained from his journey, having just flown into this city after a job that had taken him many thousands of miles in twelve hours. He took a sip of his second tonic water and stared at the colorful array of bottles behind the bar. Any man can stay sober in a desert, he mused, but only the loyal can sit in an oasis and refuse to part his lips. Avila had not parted his lips for the devil in almost a year. As he eyed his reflection in the mirrored bar, he permitted himself a rare moment of contentment with the image looking back at him. Avila was one of those fortunate Mediterranean men for whom aging seemed to be more an asset than a liability. Over the years, his stiff black stubble had softened to a distinguished salt-and-pepper beard, his fiery dark eyes had relaxed to a serene confidence, and his taut olive skin was now sun-drenched and creased, giving him the aura of a man permanently squinting out to sea. Even at sixty-three years old, his body was lean and toned, an impressive physique further enhanced by his tailored uniform. At the moment, Avila was clothed in his full-dress navy whites�a regal-looking livery consisting of a double-breasted white jacket, broad black shoulder boards, an imposing array of service medals, a starched white standing-collar shirt, and silk-trimmed white slacks. The Spanish Armada may not be the most potent navy on earth anymore, but we still know how to dress an officer. The admiral had not donned this uniform in years�but this was a special night, and earlier, as he walked the streets of this unknown town, he had enjoyed the favorable looks of women as well as the wide berth afforded him by men. Everyone respects those who live by a code. "lOtra tonica?" the pretty barmaid asked. She was in her thirties, was full- figured, and had a playful smile. Avila shook his head. "No, gracias." This pub was entirely empty, and Avila could feel the barmaid's eyes admiring him. It felt good to be seen again. I have returned from the abyss. The horrific event that all but destroyed Avila's life five years ago would forever lurk in the recesses of his mind�a single deafening instant in which the earth had opened up and swallowed him whole. Cathedral of Seville. Easter morning. The Andalusian sun was streaming through stained glass, splashing kaleidoscopes of color in radiant bursts across the cathedral's stone interior. The pipe organ thundered in joyous celebration as thousands of worshippers celebrated the miracle of resurrection. Avila knelt at the Communion rail, his heart swelling with gratitude. After a lifetime of service to the sea, he had been blessed with the greatest of God's gifts �a family. Smiling broadly, Avila turned and glanced back over his shoulder at his young wife, Maria, who was still seated in the pews, far too pregnant to make the long walk up the aisle. Beside her, their three-year-old son, Pepe, waved excitedly at his father. Avila winked at the boy, and Maria smiled warmly at her husband. Thank you, God, Avila thought as he turned back to the railing to accept the chalice. An instant later, a deafening explosion ripped through the pristine cathedral. In a flash of light, his entire world erupted in fire. The blast wave drove Avila violently forward into the Communion rail, his body crushed by the scalding surge of debris and human body parts. When Avila regained consciousness, he was unable to breathe in the thick smoke, and for a moment he had no idea where he was or what had happened. Then, above the ringing in his ears, he heard the anguished screams. Avila clambered to his feet, realizing with horror where he was. He told himself this was all a terrible dream. He staggered back through the smoke-filled cathedral, clambering past moaning and mutilated victims, stumbling in desperation to the approximate area where his wife and son had been smiling only moments ago. There was nothing there. No pews. No people. Only bloody debris on the charred stone floor. The grisly memory was mercifully shattered by the chime of the jangling bar door. Avila seized his tonica and took a quick sip, shaking off the darkness as he had been forced to do so many times before. The bar door swung wide, and Avila turned to see two burly men stumble in. They were singing an off-key Irish fight song and wearing green futbol jerseys that strained to cover their bellies. Apparently, this afternoon's match had gone the way of Ireland's visiting team. I'll take that as my cue, Avila thought, standing up. He asked for his bill, but the barmaid winked and waved him off. Avila thanked her and turned to go. "Bloody hell!" one of the newcomers shouted, staring at Avila's stately uniform. "It's the king of Spain!" Both men erupted with laughter, lurching toward him. Avila attempted to step around them and leave, but the larger man roughly grabbed his arm and pulled him back to a bar stool. "Hold on, Your Highness! We came all the way to Spain; we're gonna have a pint with the king!" Avila eyed the man's grubby hand on his freshly pressed sleeve. "Let go," he said quietly. "I need to leave." "No ... you need to stay for a beer, amigo" The man tightened his grip as his friend started poking with a dirty finger at the medals on Avila's chest. "Looks like you're quite a hero, Pops." The man tugged on one of Avila's most prized emblems. "A medieval mace? So, you're a knight in shining armor?!" He guffawed. Tolerance, Avila reminded himself. He had met countless men like these� simpleminded, unhappy souls, who had never stood for anything, men who blindly abused the liberties and freedoms that others had fought to give them. "Actually," Avila replied gently, "the mace is the symbol of the Spanish navy's Unidad de Operaciones Especiales." "Special ops?" The man feigned a fearful shudder. "That's very impressive. And what about that symbol?" He pointed to Avila's right hand. Avila glanced down at his palm. In the center of the soft flesh was inscribed a black tattoo�a symbol that dated back to the fourteenth century. This marking serves as my protection, Avila thought, eyeing the emblem. Although I will not need it. "Never mind," the hooligan said, finally letting go of Avila's arm and turning his attention to the barmaid. "You're a cute one," he said. "Are you a hundred percent Spanish?" "I am," she answered graciously. "You don't have some Irish in you?" "No." "Would you like some?" The man convulsed in hysterics and pounded the bar. "Leave her alone," Avila commanded. The man wheeled, glaring at him. The second thug poked Avila hard in the chest. "You trying to tell us what to do?" Avila took a deep breath, feeling tired after this day's long journey, and he motioned to the bar. "Gentlemen, please sit down. I'll buy you a beer." I'm glad he's staying, the barmaid thought. Although she could take care of herself, witnessing how calmly this officer was dealing with these two brutes had left her a little weak-kneed and hoping he might stay until closing time. The officer had ordered two beers, and another tonic water for himself, reclaiming his seat at the bar. The two futbol hooligans sat on either side of him. "Tonic water?" one taunted. "I thought we were drinking together." The officer gave the barmaid a tired smile and finished his tonic. "I'm afraid I have an appointment," the officer said, standing up. "But enjoy your beers." As he stood, both men, as if rehearsed, slammed rough hands on his shoulders and shoved him back onto the stool. A spark of anger flashed across the officer's eyes and then disappeared. "Grandpa, I don't think you want to leave us alone with your girlfriend here." The thug looked at her and did something disgusting with his tongue. The officer sat quietly for a long moment, and then reached into his jacket. Both guys grabbed him. "Hey! What are you doing?!" Very slowly, the officer pulled out a cell phone and said something to the men in Spanish. They stared at him uncomprehendingly, and he switched back to English. "I'm sorry, I just need to call my wife and tell her I'll be late. It looks like I'm going to be here awhile." "Now you're talking, mate!" the larger of the two said, draining his beer and slamming the glass down on the bar. "Another!" As the barmaid refilled the thugs' glasses, she watched in the mirror as the officer touched a few keys on his phone and then held it to his ear. The call went through, and he spoke in rapid Spanish. "Le llamo desde el bar Molly Malone," the officer said, reading the bar's name and address off the coaster before him. "Calle Pardcular de Estraunza, ocho." He waited a moment and then continued. "Necesitamos ayuda inmediatamente. Hay dos hombres heridos." Then he hung up. IDos hombres heridos? The barmaid's pulse quickened. Two wounded men? Before she could process his meaning, there was a blur of white, and the officer spun to his right, sending an elbow smashing upward into the larger thug's nose with a sickening crunch. The man's face erupted in red and he fell back. Before the second man could react, the officer spun again, this time to his left, his other elbow crashing hard into the man's windpipe and sending him backward off the stool. The barmaid stared in shock at the two men on the floor, one screaming in agony, the other gasping and clutching his throat. The officer stood slowly. With an eerie calm, he removed his wallet and placed a hundred-euro note on the bar. "My apologies," he said to her in Spanish. "The police will be here shortly to help you." Then he turned and left. Outside, Admiral Avila inhaled the night air and made his way along Alameda de Mazarredo toward the river. Police sirens approached, and he slipped into the shadows to let the authorities pass. There was serious work to do, and Avila could not afford further complications tonight. The Regent clearly outlined tonight's mission. For Avila, there was a simple serenity in taking orders from the Regent. No decisions. No culpability. Just action. After a career of giving commands, it was a relief to relinquish the helm and let others steer this ship. In this war, I am a foot soldier. Several days ago, the Regent had shared with him a secret so disturbing that Avila had seen no choice but to offer himself fully to the cause. The brutality of last night's mission still haunted him, and yet he knew his actions would be forgiven. Righteousness exists in many forms. And more death will come before tonight is over. As Avila emerged into an open plaza on the riverbank, he raised his eyes to the massive structure before him. It was an undulating mess of perverse forms covered in metal tile�as if two thousand years of architectural progress had been tossed out the window in favor of total chaos. Some call this a museum. I call it a monstrosity. Focusing his thoughts, Avila crossed the plaza, winding his way through a series of bizarre sculptures outside Bilbao's Guggenheim Museum. As he neared the building, he watched dozens of guests mingling in their finest black and white. The godless masses have congregated. But tonight will not go as any of them imagine. He straightened his admiral's cap and smoothed his jacket, mentally fortifying himself for the task that lay ahead. Tonight was part of a far greater mission�a crusade of righteousness. As Avila crossed the courtyard toward the museum's entrance, he gently touched the rosary in his pocket. CHAPTER 3 the museum atrium felt like a futuristic cathedral. As Langdon stepped inside, his gaze shifted immediately skyward, climbing a set of colossal white pillars along a towering curtain of glass, ascending two hundred feet to a vaulted ceiling, where halogen spotlights blazed pure white light. Suspended in the air, a network of catwalks and balconies traversed the heavens, dotted with black-and-white-clad visitors who moved in and out of the upper galleries and stood at high windows, admiring the lagoon below. Nearby, a glass elevator slid silently back down the wall, returning to earth to collect more guests. It was like no museum Langdon had ever seen. Even the acoustics felt foreign. Instead of the traditional reverent hush created by sound-dampening finishes, this place was alive with murmuring echoes of voices percolating off the stone and glass. For Langdon, the only familiar sensation was the sterile tang on the back of his tongue; museum air was the same worldwide�filtered meticulously of all particulates and oxidants and then moistened with ionized water to 45 percent humidity. Langdon moved through a series of surprisingly tight security points, noticing more than a few armed guards, and finally found himself standing at another check-in table. A young woman was handing out headsets. "Audioguia?" Langdon smiled. "No, thank you." As he neared the table, though, the woman stopped him, switching to perfect English. "I'm sorry, sir, but our host tonight, Mr. Edmond Kirsch, has asked that everyone wear a headset. It's part of the evening's experience." "Oh, of course, I'll take one." Langdon reached for a headset, but she waved him off, checking his name tag against a long list of guests, finding his name, and then handing him a headset whose number was matched with his name. "The tours tonight are customized for each individual visitor." Really? Langdon looked around. There are hundreds of guests. Langdon eyed the headset, which was nothing but a sleek loop of metal with tiny pads at each end. Perhaps seeing his puzzled look, the young woman came around to help him. "These are quite new," she said, helping him don the device. "The transducer pads don't go inside your ears, but rather rest on your face." She placed the loop behind his head and positioned the pads so that they gently clamped onto his face, just above the jawbone and below the temple. "But how�" "Bone conduction technology. The transducers drive sound directly into the bones of your jaw, allowing sound to reach your cochlea directly. I tried it earlier, and it's really quite amazing�like having a voice inside your head. What's more, it leaves your ears free to have outside conversations." "Very clever." "The technology was invented by Mr. Kirsch more than a decade ago. It's now available in many brands of consumer headphones." I hope Ludwig van Beethoven gets his cut, Langdon thought, fairly certain that the original inventor of bone conduction technology was the eighteenth-century composer who, upon going deaf, discovered he could affix a metal rod to his piano and bite down on it while he played, enabling him to hear perfectly through vibrations in his jawbone. "We hope you enjoy your tour experience," the woman said. "You have about an hour to explore the museum before the presentation. Your audio guide will alert you when it is time to go upstairs to the auditorium." "Thank you. Do I need to press anything to�" "No, the device is self-activating. Your guided tour will begin as soon as you start moving." "Ah yes, of course," Langdon said with a smile. He headed out across the atrium, moving toward a scattering of other guests, all waiting for the elevators and wearing similar headsets pressed to their jawbones. He was only halfway across the atrium when a male voice sounded in his head. "Good evening and welcome to the Guggenheim in Bilbao." Langdon knew it was his headset, but he still stopped short and looked behind him. The effect was startling�precisely as the young woman had described� like having someone inside your head. "A most heartfelt welcome to you, Professor Langdon." The voice was friendly and light, with a jaunty British accent. "My name is Winston, and I'm honored to be your guide this evening." Who did they get to record this�Hugh Grant? "Tonight," the cheery voice continued, "you may feel free to meander as you wish, anywhere you like, and I'll endeavor to enlighten you as to what it is you're viewing." Apparently, in addition to a chirpy narrator, personalized recordings, and bone conduction technology, each headset was equipped with GPS to discern precisely where in the museum the visitor was standing and therefore what commentary to generate. "I do realize, sir," the voice added, "that as a professor of art, you are one of our more savvy guests, and so perhaps you will have little need of my input. Worse yet, it is possible you will wholly disagree with my analysis of certain pieces!" The voice gave an awkward chuckle. Seriously? Who wrote this script? The merry tone and personalized service were admittedly a charming touch, but Langdon could not imagine the amount of effort it must have taken to customize hundreds of headsets. Thankfully, the voice fell silent now, as if it had exhausted its preprogrammed welcome dialogue. Langdon glanced across the atrium at another enormous red banner suspended above the crowd. EDMOND KIRSCH TONIGHT WE MOVE FORWARD What in the world is Edmond going to announce? Langdon turned his eyes to the elevators, where a cluster of chatting guests included two famous founders of global Internet companies, a prominent Indian actor, and various other well-dressed VIPs whom Langdon sensed he probably should know but didn't. Feeling both disinclined and ill-prepared to make small talk on the topics of social media and Bollywood, Langdon moved in the opposite direction, drifting toward a large piece of modern art that stood against the far wall. The installation was nestled in a dark grotto and consisted of nine narrow conveyor belts that emerged from slits in the floor and raced upward, disappearing into slits in the ceiling. The piece resembled nine moving walkways running on a vertical plane. Each conveyor bore an illuminated message, which scrolled skyward. I pray aloud ... I smell you on my skin ... I say your name. As Langdon got closer, though, he realized that the moving bands were in fact stationary; the illusion of motion was created by a "skin" of tiny LED lights positioned on each vertical beam. The lights lit up in rapid succession to form words that materialized out of the floor, raced up the beam, and disappeared into the ceiling. I'm crying hard ... There was blood ... No one told me. Langdon moved in and around the vertical beams, taking it all in. "This is a challenging piece," the audio guide declared, returning suddenly. "It is called Installation for Bilbao and was created by conceptual artist Jenny Holzer. It consists of nine LED signboards, each forty feet tall, transmitting quotes in Basque, Spanish, and English�all relating to the horrors of AIDS and the pain endured by those left behind." Langdon had to admit, the effect was mesmerizing and somehow heartbreaking. "Perhaps you've seen Jenny Holzer's work before?" Langdon felt hypnotized by the text coursing skyward. I bury my head ... I bury your head ... I bury you. "Mr. Langdon?" the voice in his head chimed. "Can you hear me? Is your headset working?" Langdon was jolted from his thoughts. "I'm sorry� what? Hello?" "Yes, hello," the voice replied. "I believe we've already said our greetings? I'm just checking to see if you can hear me?" "I ... I'm sorry," Langdon stammered, spinning away from the exhibit and looking out across the atrium. "I thought you were a recording ! I didn't realize I had a real person on the line." Langdon pictured a cubicle farm manned by an army of curators armed with headsets and museum catalogs. "No problem, sir. I'll be your personal guide for the evening. Your headset has a microphone in it as well. This program is intended as an interactive experience in which you and I can have a dialogue about art." Langdon could now see that other guests were also speaking into their headsets. Even those who had come as couples appeared to have separated a bit, exchanging bemused looks as they carried on private conversations with their personal docents. "Every guest here has a private guide?" "Yes, sir. Tonight we are individually touring three hundred and eighteen guests." "That's incredible." "Well, as you know, Edmond Kirsch is an avid fan of art and technology. He designed this system specifically for museums, in hopes of replacing group tours, which he despises. This way, every visitor can enjoy a private tour, move at his own pace, ask the question he might be embarrassed to ask in a group situation. It is really much more intimate and immersive." "Not to sound old-fashioned, but why not just walk each of us around in person?" "Logistics," the man replied. "Adding personal docents to a museum event would literally double the number of people on the floor and necessarily cut in half the number of possible visitors. Moreover, the cacophony of all the docents lecturing simultaneously would be distracting. The idea here is to make discussion a seamless experience. One of the objectives of art, Mr. Kirsch always says, is to promote dialogue." "I entirely agree," Langdon replied, "and that's why people often visit museums with a date or a friend. These headsets might be considered a bit antisocial." "Well," the Brit replied, "if you come with a date or friends, you can assign all the headsets to a single docent and enjoy a group discussion. The software is really quite advanced." "You seem to have an answer for everything." "That is, in fact, my job." The guide gave an embarrassed laugh and abruptly shifted gears. "Now, Professor, if you move across the atrium toward the windows, youTl see the museum's largest painting." As Langdon began walking across the atrium, he passed an attractive thirtysomething couple wearing matching white baseball caps. Emblazoned on the front of both caps, rather than a corporate logo, was a surprising symbol. It was an icon Langdon knew well, and yet he had never seen it on a cap. In recent years, this highly stylized letter A had become the universal symbol for one of the planet's fastest-growing and increasingly vocal demographics� atheists�who had begun speaking out more forcefully every day against what they considered the dangers of religious belief. Atheists now have their own baseball caps? As he surveyed the congregation of tech-sawy geniuses mingling around him, Langdon reminded himself that many of these young analytical minds were probably very antireligious, just like Edmond. Tonight's audience was not exactly the "home crowd" for a professor of religious symbology.

ConspiracyNet will continue to monitor this story and deliver news as we receive it. CHAPTER 5 the largest synagogue in Europe is located in Budapest on Dohany Street. Built in the Moorish style with massive twin spires, the shrine has seats for more than three thousand worshippers�with downstairs pews for the men and balcony benches for the women. Outside in the garden, in a mass burial pit, are interred the bodies of hundreds of Hungarian Jews who died during the horrors of the Nazi occupation. The site is marked by a Tree of Life�a metal sculpture depicting a weeping willow whose leaves are each inscribed with the name of a victim. When a breeze blows, the metal leaves rattle against one another, clattering with an eerie echo above the hallowed ground. For more than three decades, the spiritual leader of the Great Synagogue had been the eminent Talmudic scholar and Kabbalist�Rabbi Yehuda Koves�who, despite his advancing years and poor health, remained an active member of the Jewish community both in Hungary and around the world. As the sun set across the Danube, Rabbi Koves exited the synagogue. He made his way past the boutiques and mysterious "ruin bars" of Dohany Street en route to his home on Marcius 15 Square, a stone's throw from Elisabeth Bridge, which linked the ancient cities of Buda and Pest, which were formally united in 1873. The Passover holidays were fast approaching�normally one of Koves's most joyous times of the year�and yet, ever since his return last week from the Parliament of the World's Religions, he had been feeling only a bottomless disquiet. I wish I had never attended. The extraordinary meeting with Bishop Valdespino, Allamah Syed al-Fadl, and futurist Edmond Kirsch had plagued Koves's thoughts for three full days. Now, as Koves arrived home, he strode directly to his courtyard garden and unlocked his haziko �the small cottage that served as his private sanctuary and study. The cottage was a single room with high bookshelves that sagged under the weight of religious tomes. Koves strode to his desk and sat down, frowning at the mess before him. If anyone saw my desk this week, they'd think I'd lost my mind. Strewn across the work surface, a half-dozen obscure religious texts lay open, plastered with sticky notes. Behind them, propped open on wooden stands, were three heavy volumes�Hebrew, Aramaic, and English versions of the Torah� each opened to the same book. Genesis. In the beginning... Koves could, of course, recite Genesis from memory, in all three languages; he was more likely to be reading academic commentary on the Zohar or advanced Kabbalistic cosmology theory. For a scholar of Koves's caliber to study Genesis was much like Einstein going back to study grade-school arithmetic. Nonetheless, that's what the rabbi had been doing this week, and the notepad on his desk looked to have been assaulted by a wild torrent of hand- scrawled notes, so messy that Koves could barely make them out himself. I look like I've turned into a lunatic. Rabbi Koves had started with the Torah�the Genesis story shared by Jews and Christians alike. In the beginning God created the heaven and the earth. Next, he had turned to the instructional texts of the Talmud, rereading the rabbinic elucidations on Ma'aseh Bereshit �the Act of Creation. After that, he delved into the Midrash, poring over the commentaries of various venerated exegetes who had attempted to explain the perceived contradictions in the traditional Creation story. Finally, Koves buried himself in the mystical Kabbalistic science of the Zohar, in which the unknowable God manifested as ten different sephirot, or dimensions, arranged along channels called the Tree of Life, and from which blossomed four separate universes. The arcane complexity of the beliefs that made up Judaism had always been comforting to Koves�a reminder from God that humankind was not meant to understand all things. And yet now, after viewing Edmond Kirsch's presentation, and contemplating the simplicity and clarity of what Kirsch had discovered, Koves felt like he had spent the past three days staring into a collection of outdated contradictions. At one point, all he could do was push aside his ancient texts and go for a long walk along the Danube to gather his thoughts. Rabbi Koves had finally begun to accept a painful truth: Kirsch's work would indeed have devastating repercussions for the faithful souls of this world. The scientist's revelation boldly contradicted almost every established religious doctrine, and it did so in a distressingly simple and persuasive manner. I cannot forget that final image, Koves thought, recalling the distressing conclusion of Kirsch's presentation that they had watched on Kirsch's oversized phone. This news will affect every human being�not just the pious. Now, despite his reflections over the last few days, Rabbi Koves still felt no closer to knowing what to do with the information that Kirsch had provided. He doubted Valdespino and al-Fadl had found any clarity either. The three men had communicated by phone two days ago, but the conversation had not been productive. "My friends," Valdespino had begun. "Obviously, Mr. Kirsch's presentation was disturbing ... on many levels. I urged him to call and discuss it further with me, but he has gone silent. Now I believe we have a decision to make." "I've made my decision," said al-Fadl. "We cannot sit idly by. We need to take control of this situation. Kirsch has a well-publicized scorn for religion, and he will frame his discovery in a way to do as much damage as possible to the future of faith. We must be proactive. We must announce his discovery ourselves. Immediately. We must cast it in the proper light so as to soften the impact, and make it as nonthreatening as possible to the believers in the spiritual world." "I realize we discussed going public," Valdespino said, "but unfortunately, I cannot imagine how one frames this information in a nonthreatening way." He sighed heavily. "There is also the issue of our vow to Mr. Kirsch that we would keep his secret." "True," al-Fadl said, "and I too am conflicted about breaking that vow, but I feel we must choose the lesser of two evils and take action on behalf of the greater good. We are all under attack�Muslims, Jews, Christians, Hindus, all religions alike�and considering that our faiths all concur on the fundamental truths that Mr. Kirsch is undermining, we have an obligation to present this material in a way that does not distress our communities." "I fear there is no way this will make any sense," Valdespino said. "If we are entertaining the notion of going public with Kirsch's news, the only viable approach will be to cast doubt on his discovery�to discredit him before he can get his message out." "Edmond Kirsch?" al-Fadl challenged. "A brilliant scientist who has never been wrong about anything? Were we all in the same meeting with Kirsch? His presentation was persuasive." Valdespino grunted. "No more persuasive than presentations made by Galileo, Bruno, or Copernicus in their day. Religions have been in this predicament before. This is just science banging on our door once again." "But on a far deeper level than the discoveries of physics and astronomy!" al- Fadl exclaimed. "Kirsch is challenging the very core �the fundamental root of everything we believe! You can cite history all you like, but don't forget, despite your Vatican's best efforts to silence men like Galileo, his science eventually prevailed. And Kirsch's will too. There is no way to stop this from happening." There was a grave silence. "My position on this matter is simple," Valdespino said. "I wish Edmond Kirsch had not made this discovery. I fear that we are unprepared to handle his findings. And my strong preference is that this information never see the light of day." He paused. "At the same time, I believe that the events of our world happen according to God's plan. Perhaps with prayer, God will speak to Mr. Kirsch and persuade him to reconsider making his discovery public." Al-Fadl scoffed audibly. "I don't think Mr. Kirsch is the kind of man capable of hearing the voice of God." "Perhaps not," Valdespino said. "But miracles happen every day." Al-Fadl fired back hotly, "With all due respect, unless you're praying that God strikes Kirsch dead before he can announce�" "Gentlemen!" Koves intervened, attempting to defuse the growing tension. "Our decision need not be rushed. We don't need to reach a consensus tonight. Mr. Kirsch said his announcement is a month away. Might I suggest that we meditate privately on the matter, and speak again in several days? Perhaps the proper course will reveal itself through reflection." "Wise counsel," Valdespino replied. "We should not wait too long," al-Fadl cautioned. "Fet's speak again by phone two days from now." "Agreed," Valdespino said. "We can make our final decision at that time." That had been two days ago, and now the night of their follow-up conversation had arrived. Alone in his haziko study, Rabbi Koves was growing anxious. Tonight's scheduled call was now almost ten minutes overdue. At last, the phone rang, and Koves seized it. "Hello, Rabbi," said Bishop Valdespino, sounding troubled. "I'm sorry for the delay." He paused. "I'm afraid Allamah al-Fadl will not be joining us on this call." "Oh?" Koves said with surprise. "Is everything all right?" "I don't know. I've been trying to reach him all day, but the allamah seems to have ... disappeared. None of his colleagues have any idea where he is." Koves felt a chill. "That's alarming." "I agree. I hope he is okay. Unfortunately, I have more news." The bishop paused, his tone darkening further. "I have just learned that Edmond Kirsch is holding an event to share his discovery with the world ... tonight." "Tonight?!" Koves demanded. "He said it would be a month!" "Yes," Valdespino said. "He lied." CHAPTER 6 Winston's friendly voice reverberated in Langdon's headset. "Directly in front of you, Professor, you will see the largest painting in our collection, though most guests do not spot it right away." Langdon gazed across the museum's atrium but saw nothing except a wall of glass that looked out over the lagoon. "I'm sorry, I think I may be in the majority here. I don't see a painting." "Well, it is displayed rather unconventionally," Winston said with a laugh. "The canvas is mounted not on the wall, but rather on the floor" I should have guessed, Langdon thought, lowering his gaze and moving forward until he saw the sprawling rectangular canvas stretched out across the stone at his feet. The enormous painting consisted of a single color�a monochrome field of deep blue�and viewers stood around its perimeter, staring down at it as if peering into a small pond. "This painting is nearly six thousand square feet," Winston offered. Langdon realized it was ten times the size of his first Cambridge apartment. "It is by Yves Klein and has become affectionately known as The Swimming Pool." Langdon had to admit that the arresting richness of this shade of blue gave him the sense he could dive directly into the canvas. "Klein invented this color," Winston continued. "It's called International Klein Blue, and he claimed its profundity evoked the immateriality and boundlessness of his own utopian vision of the world." Langdon sensed Winston was now reading from a script. "Klein is best known for his blue paintings, but he is also known for a disturbing trick photograph called Leap into the Void, which caused quite a panic when it was revealed in 1960." Langdon had seen Leap into the Void at the Museum of Modern Art in New York. The photo was more than a little disconcerting, depicting a well-dressed man doing a swan dive off a high building and plunging toward the pavement. In truth, the image was a trick�brilliantly conceived and devilishly retouched with a razor blade, long before the days of Photoshop. "In addition," Winston said, "Klein also composed the musical piece Monotone-Silence, in which a symphony orchestra performs a single D-major chord for a full twenty minutes." "And people listen ?" "Thousands. And the one chord is just the first movement. In the second movement, the orchestra sits motionless and performs �pure silence' for twenty minutes." "You're joking, right?" "No, I'm quite serious. In its defense, the performance was probably not as dull as it might sound; the stage also included three naked women, slathered in blue paint, rolling around on giant canvases." Although Langdon had devoted the better part of his career to studying art, it troubled him that he had never quite learned how to appreciate the art world's more avant-garde offerings. The appeal of modern art remained a mystery to him. "I mean no disrespect, Winston, but I've got to tell you, I often find it hard to know when something is �modern art' and when something is just plain bizarre." Winston's reply was deadpan. "Well, that is often the question, isn't it? In your world of classical art, pieces are revered for the artist's skill of execution� that is, how deftly he places the brush to canvas or the chisel to stone. In modern art, however, masterpieces are often more about the idea than the execution. For example, anyone could easily compose a forty-minute symphony consisting of nothing but one chord and silence, but it was Yves Klein who had the idea." "Fair enough." "Of course, The Fog Sculpture outside is a perfect example of conceptual art. The artist had an idea �to run perforated pipes beneath the bridge and blow fog onto the lagoon�but the creation of the piece was performed by local plumbers." Winston paused. "Although I do give the artist very high marks for using her medium as a code." "Fog is a code?" "It is. A cryptic tribute to the museum's architect." "Frank Gehry?" "Frank O. Gehry," Winston corrected. "Clever." As Langdon moved toward the windows, Winston said, "You have a nice view of the spider from here. Did you see Maman on your way in?" Langdon gazed out the window, across the lagoon, to the massive black widow sculpture on the plaza. "Yes. She's pretty hard to miss." "I sense from your intonation that you're not a fan?" "I'm trying to be." Langdon paused. "As a classicist, I'm a bit of a fish out of water here." "Interesting," Winston said. "I had imagined that you of all people would appreciate Maman. She is a perfect example of the classical notion of juxtaposition. In fact, you might want to use her in class when you next teach the concept." Langdon eyed the spider, seeing nothing of the sort. When it came to teaching juxtaposition, Langdon preferred something a bit more traditional. "I think I'll stick with the David." "Yes, Michelangelo is the gold standard," Winston said with a chuckle, "brilliantly posing David in an effeminate contrapposto, his limp wrist casually holding a flaccid slingshot, conveying a feminine vulnerability. And yet David's eyes radiate a lethal determination, his tendons and veins bulging in anticipation of killing Goliath. The work is simultaneously delicate and deadly." Langdon was impressed with the description and wished his own students had as clear an understanding of Michelangelo's masterpiece. "Maman is no different from David," Winston said. "An equally bold juxtaposition of opposing archetypal principles. In nature, the black widow is a fearful creature�a predator who captures victims in her web and kills them. Despite being lethal, she is depicted here with a burgeoning egg sac, preparing to give life, making her both predator and progenitor�a powerful core perched atop impossibly slender legs, conveying both strength and fragility. Maman could be called a modern-day David, if you will." "I won't," Langdon replied, smiling, "but I must admit your analysis gives me food for thought." "Good, then let me show you one final work. It happens to be an Edmond Kirsch original." "Really? I never knew Edmond was an artist." Winston laughed. "I'll let you be the judge of that." Langdon let Winston guide him past the windows to a spacious alcove in which a group of guests had assembled before a large slab of dried mud hanging on the wall. At first glance, the slab of hardened clay reminded Langdon of a museum fossil exhibit. But this mud contained no fossils. Instead, it bore crudely etched markings similar to those a child might draw with a stick in wet cement. The crowd looked unimpressed. "Edmond did this?" grumbled a mink-clad woman with Botoxed lips. "I don't get it." The teacher in Langdon could not resist. "It's actually quite clever," he interrupted. "So far it's my favorite piece in the entire museum." The woman spun, eyeing him with more than a hint of disdain. "Oh really ? Then do enlighten me." I'd be happy to. Langdon walked over to the series of markings etched coarsely into the clay surface. <> r> q "Well, first of all," Langdon said, "Edmond inscribed this piece in clay as an homage to mankind's earliest written language, cuneiform." The woman blinked, looking uncertain. "The three heavy markings in the middle," Langdon continued, "spell the word �fish' in Assyrian. It's called a pictogram. If you look carefully, you can imagine the fish's open mouth facing right, as well as the triangular scales on his body." The assembled group all cocked their heads, studying the work again. "And if you look over here," Langdon said, pointing to the series of depressions to the left of the fish, "you can see that Edmond made footprints in the mud behind the fish, to represent the fish's historic evolutionary step onto land." Heads began to nod appreciatively. "And finally," Langdon said, "the asymmetrical asterisk on the right�the symbol that the fish appears to be consuming�is one of history's oldest symbols for God." The Botoxed woman turned and scowled at him. "A fish is eating God?" "Apparently so. It's a playful version of the Darwin fish�evolution consuming religion." Langdon gave the group a casual shrug. "As I said, pretty clever." As Langdon walked off, he could hear the crowd muttering behind him, and Winston let out a laugh. "Very amusing, Professor! Edmond would have appreciated your impromptu lecture. Not many people decipher that one." "Well," Langdon said, "that is, in fact, my job." "Yes, and I can now see why Mr. Kirsch asked me to consider you an extra� special guest. In fact, he asked me to show you something that none of the other guests are going to experience tonight." "Oh? What would that be?" "To the right of the main windows, do you see a hallway that is cordoned off?" Langdon peered to his right. "I do." "Good. Please follow my directions." Uncertain, Langdon obeyed Winston's step-by-step instructions. He walked to the corridor entrance, and after double-checking that nobody was watching, he discreetly squeezed in behind the stanchions and slipped down the hallway out of sight. Now, having left the atrium crowd behind, Langdon walked thirty feet to a metal door with a numeric keypad. "Type these six digits," Winston said, providing Langdon with the numbers. Langdon typed the code, and the door clicked. "Okay, Professor, please enter." Langdon stood a moment, uncertain what to expect. Then, gathering himself, he pushed open the door. The space beyond was almost entirely dark. "I'll bring the lights up for you," Winston said. "Please walk in and close the door." Langdon inched inside, straining to see into the darkness. He closed the door behind him, and the lock clicked. Gradually, soft lighting began to glow around the edges of the room, revealing an unthinkably cavernous space�a single gaping chamber�like an airplane hangar for a fleet of jumbo jets. "Thirty-four thousand square feet," Winston offered. The room entirely dwarfed the atrium. As the lights continued to glow brighter, Langdon could see a group of massive forms out on the floor�seven or eight murky silhouettes�like dinosaurs grazing in the night. "What in the world am I looking at?" Langdon demanded. "It's called The Matter of Time." Winston's cheery voice reverberated through Langdon's headset. "It's the heaviest piece of art in the museum. Over two million pounds." Langdon was still trying to get his bearings. "And why am I in here alone?" "As I said, Mr. Kirsch asked me to show you these amazing objects." The lights increased to full strength, flooding the vast space with a soft glow, and Langdon could only stare in bewilderment at the scene before him. I've entered a parallel universe. CHAPTER 7 admiral luis Avila arrived at the museum's security checkpoint and glanced at his watch to assure himself he was on schedule. Perfect. He presented his Documento Nacional de Identidad to the employees manning the guest list. For a moment, Avila's pulse quickened when his name could not be located on the list. Finally, they found it at the bottom�a last-minute addition �and Avila was allowed to enter. Exactly as the Regent promised me. How he had accomplished this feat, Avila had no idea. Tonight's guest list was said to be ironclad. He continued to the metal detector, where he removed his cell phone and placed it in the dish. Then, with extreme care, he extracted an unusually heavy set of rosary beads from his jacket pocket and laid it over his phone. Gently, he told himself. Very gently. The security guard waved him through the metal detector and carried the dish of personal items around to the other side. "Que rosario tan bonito," the guard said, admiring the metal rosary, which consisted of a strong beaded chain and a thick, rounded cross. "Gracias," Avila replied. I constructed it myself. Avila walked through the detector without incident. On the other side, he collected his phone and the rosary, replacing them gently in his pocket before pressing on to a second checkpoint, where he was given an unusual audio headset. I don't need an audio tour, he thought. I have work to do. As he moved across the atrium, he discreetly dumped the headset into a trash receptacle. His heart was pounding as he scanned the building for a private place to contact the Regent and let him know he was safely inside. For God, country, and king, he thought. But mostly for God. At that moment, in the deepest recesses of the moonlit desert outside Dubai, the beloved seventy-eight-year-old allamah, Syed al-Fadl, strained in agony as he crawled through deep sand. He could go no farther. Al-Fadl's skin was blistered and burned, his throat so raw he could barely pull a breath. The sand-laden winds had blinded him hours ago, and still he crawled on. At one point, he thought he heard the distant whine of dune buggies, but it was probably just the howling wind. Al-Fadl's faith that God would save him had long since passed. The vultures were no longer circling; they were walking beside him. The tall Spaniard who had carjacked al-Fadl last night had barely spoken a word as he drove the allamah 's car deep into this vast desert. After an hour's drive, the Spaniard had stopped and ordered al-Fadl out of the car, leaving him in the darkness with no food or water. Al-Fadl's captor had provided no indication of his identity or any explanation for his actions. The only possible clue al-Fadl had glimpsed was a strange marking on the man's right palm�a symbol he did not recognize. For hours, al-Fadl had trudged through sand and shouted fruitlessly for help. Now, as the severely dehydrated cleric collapsed into the suffocating sand and felt his heart give out, he asked himself the same question he had been asking for hours. Who could possibly want me dead? Frighteningly, he could come up with only one logical answer. CHAPTER 8 Robert langdon'S eyes were drawn from one colossal form to the next. Each piece was a towering sheet of weathered steel that had been elegantly curled and then set precariously on its edge, balancing itself to create a freestanding wall. The arcing walls were nearly fifteen feet tall and had been torqued into different fluid shapes�an undulating ribbon, an open circle, a loose coil. "The Matter of Time," Winston repeated. "And the artist is Richard Serra. His use of unsupported walls in such a heavy medium creates the illusion of instability. But in fact, these are all very stable. If you imagine a dollar bill that you curl around a pencil, once you remove the pencil, your coiled bill can stand quite happily on its own edge, supported by its own geometry." Langdon paused and stared up at the immense circle beside him. The metal was oxidized, giving it a burnt copper hue and a raw, organic quality. The piece exuded both great strength and a delicate sense of balance. "Professor, do you notice how this first shape is not quite closed?" Langdon continued around the circle and saw that the ends of the wall did not quite meet, as if a child had attempted to draw a circle but missed the mark. "The skewed connection creates a passageway that draws the visitor inside to explore the negative space." Unless that visitor happens to be claustrophobic, Langdon thought, moving quickly on. "Similarly," Winston said, "in front of you, you will see three sinuous ribbons of steel, running in a loosely parallel formation, close enough together to form two undulating tunnels of more than a hundred feet. It's called The Snake, and our young visitors enjoy running through it. In fact, two visitors standing at opposite ends can whisper faintly and hear each other perfectly, as if they were face-to-face." "This is remarkable, Winston, but would you please explain why Edmond asked you to show me this gallery." He knows I don't get this stuff. Winston replied, "The specific piece he asked me to show you is called Torqued Spiral, and it's up ahead in the far right corner. Do you see it?" Langdon squinted into the distance. The one that looks like it's a half mile away? "Yes, I see it." "Splendid, let's head over, shall we?" Langdon took a tentative glance around the enormous space and made his way toward the distant spiral as Winston continued speaking. "I have heard, Professor, that Edmond Kirsch is an avid admirer of your work �particularly your thoughts on the interplay of various religious traditions throughout history and their evolutions as reflected in art. In many ways, Edmond's field of game theory and predictive computing is quite similar� analyzing the growth of various systems and predicting how they will develop over time." "Well, he's obviously very good at it. They call him the modern-day Nostradamus, after all." "Yes. Though the comparison is a bit insulting, if you ask me." "Why would you say that?" Langdon countered. "Nostradamus is the most famous prognosticator of all time." "I don't mean to be contrary, Professor, but Nostradamus wrote nearly a thousand loosely worded quatrains that, over four centuries, have benefited from the creative readings of superstitious people looking to extract meaning where there is none ... everything from World War Two, to Princess Diana's death, to the attack on the World Trade Center. It's utterly absurd. In contrast, Edmond Kirsch has published a limited number of very specific predictions that have come true over a very short time horizon�cloud computing, driverless cars, a processing chip powered by only five atoms. Mr. Kirsch is no Nostradamus." I stand corrected, Langdon thought. Edmond Kirsch was said to inspire a fierce loyalty among those with whom he worked, and apparently Winston was one of Kirsch's avid disciples. "So are you enjoying my tour?" Winston asked, changing the subject. "Very much so. Kudos to Edmond for perfecting this remote docenting technology." "Yes, this system has been a dream of Edmond's for years, and he spent incalculable amounts of time and money developing it in secret." "Really? The technology doesn't seem all that complicated. I must admit, I was skeptical at first, but you've sold me�it's been quite an interesting conversation." "Generous of you to say, although I hope I don't now ruin everything by admitting the truth. I'm afraid I have not been entirely honest with you." "I'm sorry?" "First of all, my real name is not Winston. It's Art." Langdon laughed. "A museum docent named Art ? Well, I don't blame you for using a pseudonym. Nice to meet you, Art." "Furthermore, when you asked why I wouldn't just walk around with you in person, I gave you an accurate answer about Mr. Kirsch wanting to keep museum crowds small. But that answer was incomplete. There is another reason we are speaking via headset and not in person." He paused. "I am, in fact, incapable of physical movement." "Oh ... I am so sorry." Langdon imagined Art sitting in a wheelchair in a call center, and regretted that Art would feel self-conscious having to explain his condition. "No need to feel sorry for me. I assure you legs would look quite strange on me. You see, I'm not quite how you imagine." Langdon's pace slowed. "What do you mean?" "The name �Art' is not so much a name as it is an abbreviation. �Art' is short for �artificial,' although Mr. Kirsch prefers the word �synthetic.'" The voice paused a moment. "The truth of the matter, Professor, is that this evening you have been interacting with a synthetic docent. A computer of sorts." Langdon looked around, uncertain. "Is this some kind of prank?" "Not at all, Professor. I'm quite serious. Edmond Kirsch spent a decade and nearly a billion dollars in the field of synthetic intelligence, and tonight you are one of the very first to experience the fruits of his labors. Your entire tour has been given by a synthetic docent. I am not human." Langdon could not accept this for a second. The man's diction and grammar were perfect, and with the exception of a slightly awkward laugh, he was as elegant a speaker as Langdon had ever encountered. Furthermore, their banter tonight had encompassed a wide and nuanced range of topics. I'm being watched, Langdon now realized, scanning the walls for hidden video cameras. He suspected he was an unwitting participant in a strange piece of "experiential art"�an artfully staged theater of the absurd. They've made me a rat in a maze. "I'm not entirely comfortable with this," Langdon declared, his voice echoing across the deserted gallery. "My apologies," Winston said. "That is understandable. I anticipated that you might find this news difficult to process. I imagine that is why Edmond asked me to bring you in here to a private space, away from the others. This information is not being revealed to his other guests." Langdon's eyes probed the dim space to see if anyone else was there. "As you are no doubt aware," the voice continued, sounding eerily unfazed by Langdon's discomfort, "the human brain is a binary system�synapses either fire or they don't�they are on or off, like a computer switch. The brain has over a hundred trillion switches, which means that building a brain is not so much a question of technology as it is a question of scale." Langdon was barely listening. He was walking again, his attention focused on an "Exit" sign with an arrow pointing to the far end of the gallery. "Professor, I realize the human quality of my voice is hard to accept as machine-generated, but speech is actually the easy part. Even a ninety-nine- dollar e-book device does a fairly decent job of mimicking human speech. Edmond has invested billions ." Langdon stopped walking. "If you're a computer, tell me this. Where did the Dow Jones Industrial Average close on August twenty-fourth, 1974?" "That day was a Saturday," the voice replied instantly. "So the markets never opened." Langdon felt a slight chill. He had chosen the date as a trick. One of the side effects of his eidetic memory was that dates lodged themselves forever in his mind. That Saturday had been his best friend's birthday, and Langdon still remembered the afternoon pool party. Helena Wooley wore a blue bikini. "However," the voice added immediately, "on the previous day, Friday, August twenty-third, the Dow Jones Industrial Average closed at 686.80, down 17.83 points for a loss of 2.53 percent." Langdon was momentarily unable to speak. "I'm happy to wait," the voice chimed, "if you want to check the data on your smartphone. Although I'll have no choice but to point out the irony of it." "But... I don't..." "The challenge with synthetic intelligence," the voice continued, its light British air now seeming stranger than ever, "is not the rapid access to data, which is really quite simple, but rather the ability to discern how the data are interconnected and entangled�something at which I believe you excel, no? The interrelationship of ideas? This is one of the reasons Mr. Kirsch wanted to test my abilities on you specifically." "A test?" Langdon asked. "Of ... me?" "Not at all." Again, the awkward laugh. "A test of me. To see if I could convince you I was human." "A Turing test." "Precisely." The Turing test, Langdon recalled, was a challenge proposed by code-breaker Alan Turing to assess a machine's ability to behave in a manner indistinguishable from that of a human. Essentially, a human judge listened to a conversation between a machine and a human, and if the judge was unable to identify which participant was human, then the Turing test was considered to have been passed. Turing's benchmark challenge had famously been passed in 2014 at the Royal Society in London. Since then, AI technology had progressed at a blinding rate. "So far this evening," the voice continued, "not a single one of our guests has suspected a thing. They're all having a grand time." "Hold on, everyone here tonight is talking to a computer?! " "Technically, everyone is talking to me. I'm able to partition myself quite easily. You are hearing my default voice�the voice that Edmond prefers�but others are hearing other voices or languages. Based on your profile as an American academic male, I chose my default male British accent for you. I predicted that it would breed more confidence than, for example, a young female with a southern drawl." Did this thing just call me a chauvinist? Langdon recalled a popular recording that had circulated online several years ago: Time magazine's bureau chief Michael Scherer had been phoned by a telemarketing robot that was so eerily human that Scherer had posted a recording of the call online for everyone to hear. That was years ago, Langdon realized. Langdon knew that Kirsch had been dabbling in artificial intelligence for years, appearing on magazine covers from time to time to hail various breakthroughs. Apparently, his offspring "Winston" represented Kirsch's current state of the art. "I realize this is all happening quickly," the voice continued, "but Mr. Kirsch requested that I show you this spiral at which you are now standing. He asked that you please enter the spiral and continue all the way to the center." Langdon peered down the narrow curving passage and felt his muscles tighten. Is this Edmond's idea of a college prank? "Can you just tell me what's in there? I'm not a big fan of cramped spaces." "Interesting, I didn't know that about you." "Claustrophobia is not something I include in my online bio." Langdon caught himself, still unable to fathom that he was speaking to a machine. "You needn't be afraid. The space in the center of the spiral is quite large, and Mr. Kirsch requested specifically that you see the center. Before you enter, however, Edmond asked that you remove your headset and place it on the floor out here." Langdon looked at the looming structure and hesitated. "You're not coming with me?" "Apparently not." "You know, this is all very strange, and I'm not exactly�" "Professor, considering Edmond brought you all the way to this event, it seems a small request that you walk a short distance into this piece of art. Children do it every day and survive." Langdon had never been reprimanded by a computer, if that was in fact what this was, but the cutting comment had the desired effect. He removed his headset and carefully placed it on the floor, turning now to face the opening in the spiral. The high walls formed a narrow canyon that curved out of sight, disappearing into darkness. "Here goes nothing," he said to nobody at all. Langdon took a deep breath and strode into the opening. The path curled on and on, farther than he imagined, winding deeper, and Langdon soon had no idea how many rotations he had made. With each clockwise revolution, the passage grew tighter, and Langdon's broad shoulders were now nearly brushing the walls. Breathe, Robert. The slanting metal sheets felt as if they might collapse inward at any moment and crush him beneath tons of steel. Why am I doing this? A moment before Langdon was about to turn around and head back, the passageway abruptly ended, depositing him in a large open space. As promised, the chamber was larger than he expected. Langdon stepped quickly out of the tunnel into the open, exhaling as he surveyed the bare floor and high metal walls, wondering again if this was some kind of elaborate sophomoric hoax. A door clicked somewhere outside, and brisk footsteps echoed beyond the high walls. Someone had entered the gallery, coming through the nearby door that Langdon had seen. The footsteps approached the spiral and then began circling around Langdon, growing louder with every turn. Someone was entering the coil. Langdon backed up and faced the opening as the footsteps kept circling, drawing closer. The staccato clicking grew louder until, suddenly, a man appeared out of the tunnel. He was short and slender with pale skin, piercing eyes, and an unruly mop of black hair. Langdon stared stone-faced at the man for a long moment, and then, finally, permitted a broad grin to spread across his face. "The great Edmond Kirsch always makes an entrance." "Only one chance to make a first impression," Kirsch replied affably. "I've missed you, Robert. Thanks for coming." The two men shared a heartfelt embrace. As Langdon patted his old friend on the back, he sensed that Kirsch had grown thinner. "You've lost weight," Langdon said. "I went vegan," Kirsch replied. "Easier than the elliptical." Langdon laughed. "Well, it's great to see you. And, as usual, you've made me feel overdressed." "Who, me?" Kirsch glanced down at his black skinny jeans, pressed white V- neck tee, and side-zip bomber jacket. "This is couture." "White flip-flops are couture?" "Flip-flops?! These are Ferragamo Guineas." "And I'm guessing they cost more than my entire ensemble." Edmond walked over and examined the label of Eangdon's classic jacket. "Actually," he said, smiling warmly, "those are pretty nice tails. It's close." "I've got to tell you, Edmond, your synthetic friend Winston ... very unsettling." Kirsch beamed. "Incredible, right? You can't believe what I've accomplished in artificial intelligence this year�quantum leaps. I've developed a few new proprietary technologies that are enabling machines to problem-solve and self- regulate in entirely new ways. Winston is a work in progress, but he improves daily." Langdon noticed that deep creases had appeared around Edmond's boyish eyes over the past year. The man looked weary. "Edmond, would you care to tell me why you brought me here?" "To Bilbao? Or into a Richard Serra spiral?" "Let's start with the spiral," Langdon said. "You know I'm claustrophobic." "Precisely. Tonight is all about pushing people outside their comfort zones," he said with a smirk. "Always your specialty." "Moreover," Kirsch added, "I needed to speak to you, and I didn't want to be seen before the show." "Because rock stars never mingle with guests before a concert?" "Correct!" Kirsch replied jokingly. "Rock stars appear magically onstage in a puff of smoke." Overhead, the lights suddenly faded off and on. Kirsch pulled back his sleeve and checked his watch. Then he glanced to Langdon, his expression turning suddenly serious. "Robert, we don't have much time. Tonight is a tremendous occasion for me. In fact, it will be an important occasion for all of humankind." Langdon felt a flush of anticipation. "Recently, I made a scientific discovery," Edmond said. "It's a breakthrough that will have far-reaching implications. Almost nobody on earth knows about it, and tonight�very shortly�I will be addressing the world live and announcing what I've found." "I'm not sure what to say," Langdon replied. "This all sounds amazing." Edmond lowered his voice, and his tone grew uncharacteristically tense. "Before I go public with this information, Robert, I need your advice." He paused. "I fear my life may depend on it." CHAPTER 9 silence had fallen between the two men inside the spiral. I need your advice ...I fear my life may depend on it. Edmond's words hung heavily in the air and Langdon saw disquiet in his friend's eyes. "Edmond? What's going on? Are you okay?" The overhead lights faded off and on again, but Edmond ignored them. "It has been a remarkable year for me," he began, his voice a whisper. "I've been working alone on a major project, one that led to a ground-breaking discovery." "That sounds wonderful." Kirsch nodded. "It is indeed, and words can't describe how excited I am to share it with the world tonight. It will usher in a major paradigm shift. I am not exaggerating when I tell you that my discovery will have repercussions on the scale of the Copernican revolution." For a moment, Langdon thought his host was joking, but Edmond's expression remained dead serious. Copernicus? Humility had never been one of Edmond's strong suits, but this claim sounded borderline preposterous. Nicolaus Copernicus was the father of the heliocentric model�the belief that the planets revolve around the sun� which ignited a scientific revolution in the 1500s that entirely obliterated the Church's long-held teaching that mankind occupied the center of God's universe. His discovery was condemned by the Church for three centuries, but the damage had been done, and the world had never been the same. "I can see you're skeptical," Edmond said. "Would it be better if I said Darwin?" Langdon smiled. "Same issue." "Okay, then let me ask you this: What are the two fundamental questions that have been asked by the human race throughout our entire history?" Langdon considered it. "Well, the questions would have to be: �How did it all begin? Where do we come from?"' "Precisely. And the second question is simply the ancillary to that. Not �where do we come from'... but ..." "�Where are we going?"' "Yes! These two mysteries lie at the heart of the human experience. Where do we come from? Where are we going? Human creation and human destiny. They are the universal mysteries." Edmond's gaze sharpened and he peered at Langdon expectantly. "Robert, the discovery I've made ... it very clearly answers both of these questions." Langdon grappled with Edmond's words and their heady ramifications. "I'm ... not sure what to say." "No need to say anything. I'm hoping you and I can find time to discuss it in depth following tonight's presentation, but at the moment, I need to talk to you about the darker side of all this�the potential fallout from the discovery." "You think there will be repercussions?" "Without a doubt. By answering these questions, I have placed myself in direct conflict with centuries of established spiritual teachings. Issues of human creation and human destiny are traditionally the domain of religion. I'm an interloper, and the religions of the world are not going to like what I'm about to announce." "Interesting," Langdon replied. "And is this why you spent two hours grilling me about religion over lunch in Boston last year?" "It is. You may remember my personal guarantee to you�that in our lifetime, the myths of religion would be all but demolished by scientific breakthroughs." Langdon nodded. Hard to forget. The boldness of Kirsch's declaration had emblazoned itself word for word in Langdon's eidetic memory. "I do. And I countered that religion had survived advances in science for millennia, and that it served an important purpose in society, and while religion might evolve, it would never die." "Exactly. I also told you that I had found the purpose of my life�to employ the truth of science to eradicate the myth of religion." "Yes, strong words." "And you challenged me on them, Robert. You argued that whenever I came across a �scientific truth' that conflicted with or undermined the tenets of religion, I should discuss it with a religious scholar in hopes I might realize that science and religion are often attempting to tell the same story in two different languages." "I do remember. Scientists and spiritualists often use different vocabularies to describe the exact same mysteries of the universe. The conflicts are frequently over semantics, not substance." "Well, I followed your advice," Kirsch said. "And I consulted with spiritual leaders about my latest discovery." "Oh?" "Are you familiar with the Parliament of the World's Religions?" "Of course." Langdon was a great admirer of the group's efforts to promote interfaith discourse. "By chance," Kirsch said, "the parliament held their meeting outside Barcelona this year, about an hour from my home, at the Abbey of Mont-serrat." Spectacular spot, Langdon thought, having visited the mountaintop sanctuary many years ago. "When I heard it was taking place during the same week I had planned to make this major scientific announcement, I don't know, I ..." "Wondered if it might be a sign from God?" Kirsch laughed. "Something like that. So I called them." Langdon was impressed. "You addressed the entire parliament?" "No! Too dangerous. I didn't want this information leaking out before I could announce it myself, so I scheduled a meeting with only three of them�one representative each from Christianity, Islam, and Judaism. The four of us met in private in the library." "I'm amazed they let you in the library," Langdon said with surprise. "I hear that's hallowed ground." "I told them I needed a secure meeting place, no phones, no cameras, no intruders. They took me to that library. Before I told them anything, I asked them to agree to a vow of silence. They complied. To date, they are the only people on earth who know anything about my discovery." "Fascinating. And how did they react when you told them?" Kirsch looked sheepish. "I may not have handled it perfectly. You know me, Robert, when my passions flare, diplomacy is not my metier." "Yes, I've read that you could use some sensitivity training," Langdon said with a laugh. Just like Steve Jobs and so many genius visionaries. "So in keeping with my outspoken nature, I began our talk by simply telling them the truth�that I had always considered religion a form of mass delusion, and that as a scientist, I found it difficult to accept the fact that billions of intelligent people rely on their respective faiths to comfort and guide them. When they asked why I was consulting with people for whom I apparently had little respect, I told them I was there to gauge their reactions to my discovery so I could get some sense of how it would be received by the world's faithful once I made it public." "Always the diplomat," Langdon said, wincing. "You do know that sometimes honesty is not the best policy?" Kirsch waved his hand dismissively. "My thoughts on religion are widely publicized. I thought they would appreciate the transparency. Nonetheless, after that, I presented my work to them, explaining in detail what I had discovered and how it changed everything. I even took out my phone and showed them some video that I admit is quite startling. They were speechless." "They must have said something," Langdon prompted, feeling even more curious to know what Kirsch possibly could have discovered. "I was hoping for a conversation, but the Christian cleric silenced the other two before they could say a word. He urged me to reconsider making the information public. I told him I would think about it for the next month." "But you're going public tonight." "I know. I told them my announcement was still several weeks away so they wouldn't panic or try to interfere." "And when they find out about tonight's presentation?" Langdon asked. "They will not be amused. One of them in particular." Kirsch locked eyes with Langdon. "The cleric who convened our meeting was Bishop Antonio Valdespino. Do you know of him?" Langdon tensed. "From Madrid?" Kirsch nodded. "One and the same." Probably not the ideal audience for Edmond's radical atheism, Langdon thought. Valdespino was a powerful figure in the Spanish Catholic Church, known for his deeply conservative views and strong influence over the king of Spain. "He was host of the parliament this year," Kirsch said, "and therefore the one I spoke to about arranging a meeting. He offered to come personally, and I asked him to bring representatives from Islam and Judaism." The lights overhead faded again. Kirsch sighed heavily, lowering his voice further. "Robert, the reason I wanted to speak to you before my presentation is that I need your advice. I need to know if you believe that Bishop Valdespino is dangerous." "Dangerous?" Langdon said. "In what way?" "What I showed him threatens his world, and I want to know if you think I'm in any physical danger from him." Langdon immediately shook his head. "No, impossible. I'm not sure what you said to him, but Valdespino is a pillar of Spanish Catholicism, and his ties to the Spanish royal family make him extremely influential ... but he's a priest, not a hit man. He wields political power. He may preach a sermon against you, but I would find it very hard to believe that you are in any physical danger from him." Kirsch looked unconvinced. "You should have seen the way he looked at me as I left Montserrat." "You sat in that monastery's sacrosanct library and told a bishop that his entire belief system is delusional!" Langdon exclaimed. "Did you expect him to serve you tea and cake?" "No," Edmond admitted, "but I also didn't expect him to leave me a threatening voice mail after our meeting." "Bishop Valdespino called you?" Kirsch reached into his leather jacket and pulled out an unusually large smartphone. It had a bright turquoise case adorned with a repeating hexagonal pattern, which Langdon recognized as a famous tiled pattern designed by the modernist Catalan architect Antoni Gaudi. "Have a listen," Kirsch said, pressing a few buttons and holding up the phone. An elderly man's voice crackled tersely out of the speaker, his tone severe and dead serious: Mr. Kirsch, this is Bishop Antonio Valdespino. As you know, I found our meeting this morning profoundly disturbing�as did my two colleagues. I urge you to call me immediately so we can discuss this further, and I can again warn you of the dangers of going public with this information. If you do not call, be advised that my colleagues and I will consider a preemptive announcement to share your discoveries, reframe them, discredit them, and attempt to reverse the untold damage you are about to cause the world ... damage that you clearly do not foresee. I await your call, and I strongly suggest you not test my resolve. The message ended. Langdon had to admit he was startled by Valdespino's aggressive tone, and yet the voice mail did not so much frighten him as it deepened his curiosity about Edmond's impending announcement. "So, how did you respond?" "I didn't," Edmond said, slipping the phone back into his pocket. "I saw it as an idle threat. I was certain they wanted to bury this information, not announce it themselves. Moreover, I knew the sudden timing of tonight's presentation was going to take them by surprise, so I wasn't overly concerned about their taking preemptive action." He paused, eyeing Langdon. "Now ... I don't know, something about his tone of voice ... it's just been on my mind." "Are you worried you're in danger here ? Tonight?" "No, no, the guest list has been tightly controlled, and this building has excellent security. I'm more worried about what happens once I go public." Edmond seemed suddenly sorry he'd mentioned it. "It's silly. Preshow jitters. I just wanted to get your gut instinct." Langdon studied his friend with mounting concern. Edmond looked unusually pale and troubled. "My gut tells me Valdespino would never place you in danger, no matter how angry you made him." The lights dimmed again, insistently now. "Okay, thank you." Kirsch checked his watch. "I need to go, but can you and I meet later? There are some aspects of this discovery I'd like to discuss further with you." "Of course." "Perfect. Things are going to be chaotic after the presentation, so you and I will need someplace private to escape the mayhem and talk." Edmond took out a business card and started writing on the back. "After the presentation, hail a cab and give this card to the driver. Any local driver will understand where to bring you." He handed Langdon the business card. Langdon expected to see the address of a local hotel or restaurant on the back. Instead he saw what looked more like a cipher. BIO-EC346 "I'm sorry, give this to a taxi driver?" "Yes, he'll know where to go. I'll tell security there to expect you, and I'll be along as quickly as possible." Security? Langdon frowned, wondering if BIO-EC346 were the code name for some secret science club. "It's a painfully simple code, my friend." He winked. "You of all people should be able to crack it. And, by the way, just so you're not taken off guard, you'll be playing a role in my announcement tonight." Langdon was surprised. "What kind of role?" "Don't worry. You won't have to do a thing." With that, Edmond Kirsch headed across the floor toward the spiral's exit. "I've got to dash backstage�but Winston will guide you up." He paused in the doorway and turned. "I'll see you after the event. And let's hope you're right about Valdespino." "Edmond, relax. Locus on your presentation. You're not in any danger from religious clerics," Langdon assured him. Kirsch didn't look convinced. "You may feel differently, Robert, when you hear what I'm about to say." CHAPTER 10 the holy seat of the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Madrid�Catedral de la Almudena�is a robust neoclassical cathedral situated adjacent to Madrid's Royal Palace. Built on the site of an ancient mosque, Almudena Cathedral derives its name from the Arabic al-mudayna, meaning "citadel." According to legend, when Alfonso VI seized Madrid back from the Muslims in 1083, he became fixated on relocating a precious lost icon of the Virgin Mary that had been entombed in the walls of the citadel for safekeeping. Unable to locate the hidden Virgin, Alfonso prayed intently until a section of the citadel's wall exploded, falling away, and revealed the icon inside, still lit by the burning candles with which she had been entombed centuries ago. Today, the Virgin of Almudena is the patron saint of Madrid, and pilgrims and tourists alike flock to mass at Almudena Cathedral for the privilege of praying before her likeness. The church's dramatic location�sharing the Royal Palace's main plaza�provides an added attraction to churchgoers: the possibility of glimpsing royalty coming or going from the palace. Tonight, deep inside the cathedral, a young acolyte was rushing through the hallway in a panic. Where is Bishop Valdespino?! Services are about to begin! For decades, Bishop Antonio Valdespino had been head priest and overseer of this cathedral. A longtime friend and spiritual counselor to the king, Valdespino was an outspoken and devout traditionalist with almost no tolerance for modernization. Incredibly, the eighty-three-year-old bishop still donned ankle shackles during Holy Week and joined the faithful carrying icons through the city streets. Valdespino, of all people, is never late for mass. The acolyte had been with the bishop twenty minutes ago in the vestry, assisting him with his robes as usual. Just as they finished, the bishop had received a text and, without a word, had hurried out. Where did he go? Having searched the sanctuary, the vestry, and even the bishop's private restroom, the acolyte was now running at a sprint down the hallway to the administrative section of the cathedral to check the bishop's office. He heard a pipe organ thunder to life in the distance. The processional hymn is starting! The acolyte skidded to a stop outside the bishop's private office, startled to see a shaft of light beneath his closed door. He's here?! The acolyte knocked quietly. " lExcelencia Reverendisima?" No answer. Knocking louder, he called out, "\?Su Excelencia?!" Still nothing. Fearing for the old man's health, the acolyte turned the handle and pushed open the door. jCielos! The acolyte gasped as he peered into the private space. Bishop Valdespino was seated at his mahogany desk, staring into the glow of a laptop computer. His holy miter was still on his head, his chasuble wadded beneath him, and his crozier staff propped unceremoniously against the wall. The acolyte cleared his throat. "La santa misa esta �" "Preparada," the bishop interrupted, his eyes never moving from the screen. "Padre Derida me sustituye." The acolyte stared in bewilderment. Father Derida is substituting? A junior priest overseeing Saturday-night mass was highly irregular. "jVeteya!" Valdespino snapped without looking up. "Ycierra la puerta." Fearful, the boy did as he was told, leaving immediately and closing the door as he went. Hurrying back toward the sounds of the pipe organ, the acolyte wondered what the bishop could possibly be viewing on his computer that would pull his mind so far from his duties to God. At that moment, Admiral Avila was snaking through the growing crowd in the Guggenheim's atrium, puzzled to see guests chatting with their sleek headsets. Apparently the audio tour of the museum was a two-way conversation. He felt glad to have jettisoned the device. No distractions tonight. He checked his watch and eyed the elevators. They were already crowded with guests heading to the main event upstairs, so Avila opted for the stairs. As he climbed, he felt the same tremor of incredulity he had felt last night. Have I really become a man capable of killing? The godless souls who had ripped away his wife and child had transformed him. My actions are sanctioned by a higher authority, he reminded himself. There is righteousness in what I do. As Avila reached the first landing, his gaze was drawn to a woman on a nearby suspended catwalk. Spain's newest celebrity, he thought, eyeing the famous beauty. She wore a formfitting white dress with a black diagonal stripe that ran elegantly across her torso. Her slender figure, lush dark hair, and graceful carriage were easy to admire, and Avila noticed he was not the only one with eyes on her. In addition to the approving glances of the other guests, the woman in white held the full attention of two sleek security officers who shadowed her closely. The men moved with the wary confidence of panthers and wore matching blue blazers with embroidered crests and the large initials GR. Avila was not surprised by their presence, and yet the sight of them made his pulse quicken. As a former member of the Spanish armed forces, he knew full well what GR signified. These two security escorts would be armed and as well trained as any bodyguards on earth. If they are present, I must take every precaution, Avila told himself. "Hey!" a man's voice barked, directly behind him. Avila spun around. A paunchy man in a tuxedo and a black cowboy hat was smiling broadly at him. "Great costume!" the man said, pointing to Avila's military uniform. "Where does someone get something like that?" Avila stared, fists clenching reflexively. Through a lifetime of service and sacrifice, he thought. "No hablo ingles," Avila replied with a shrug, and continued up the stairs. On the second floor, Avila found a long hallway and followed signs to a remote restroom at the far end. He was about to enter when the lights throughout the museum faded off and on�the first gentle nudge urging guests to start heading upstairs for the presentation. Avila entered the deserted restroom, chose the last stall, and locked himself inside. Alone now, he felt the familiar demons trying to surface within him, threatening to drag him back into the abyss. Five years, and the memories still haunt me. Angrily, Avila pushed the horrors from his mind and retrieved the rosary beads from his pocket. Gently, he looped them over the coat hook on the door. As the beads and crucifix swung peacefully before him, he admired his handiwork. The devout might be horrified that anyone could defile the rosary by creating an object like this. Even so, Avila had been assured by the Regent that desperate times afforded a certain flexibility in the rules of absolution. When the cause is this holy, the Regent had promised, God's forgiveness is guaranteed. As with the protection of his soul, Avila's body had also been guaranteed deliverance from evil. He glanced down at the tattoo on his palm. Like the ancient crismon of Christ, the icon was a symbol constructed entirely of letters. Avila had inscribed it there three days ago with iron gall and a needle, precisely as he had been instructed, and the spot was still tender and red. If he were captured, the Regent assured him, all he had to do was make his palm visible to his captors, and within hours, he would be released. We occupy the highest levels of government, the Regent had said. Avila had already witnessed their startling influence, and it felt like a mantle of protection all around him. There still exist those who respect the ancient ways. One day Avila hoped to join the ranks of this elite, but for the moment, he felt honored to play any role at all. In the solitude of the bathroom, Avila took out his phone and dialed the secure number he had been given. The voice on the line answered on the first ring. "<?Sf ?" "Estoy en posicion," Avila replied, awaiting final instructions. "Bien," the Regent said. "Tendras una sola oportunidad. Aprovecharla sera crucial." You will have only one chance. Seizing it will be crucial. CHAPTER 11 thirty kilometers up the coastline from Dubai's glistening skyscrapers, man� made islands, and celebrity party villas lies the city of Sharjah�the ultraconservative Islamic cultural capital of the United Arab Emirates. With more than six hundred mosques and the region's finest universities, Sharjah stands as a pinnacle of spirituality and learning�a position fueled by massive oil reserves and a ruler who places the education of his people above all else. Tonight, the family of Sharjah's beloved allamah, Syed al-Fadl, had gathered in private to hold a vigil. Instead of praying the traditional tahajjud, the night vigil prayer, they prayed for the return of their cherished father, uncle, and husband, who had mysteriously disappeared yesterday without a trace. The local press had just announced that one of Syed's colleagues was claiming that the normally composed allamah had seemed "strangely agitated" upon his return from the Parliament of the World's Religions two days ago. In addition, the colleague said he had overheard Syed engaged in a rare heated phone argument shortly after his return. The dispute was in English, and therefore indecipherable to him, but the colleague swore he had heard Syed repeatedly mention a single name. Edmond Kirsch. CHAPTER 12 langdon'S thoughts swirled as he emerged from the spiral structure. His conversation with Kirsch had been both exciting and alarming. Whether or not Kirsch's claims were exaggerated, the computer scientist clearly had discovered something that he believed would cause a paradigm shift in the world. A discovery as important as the findings of Copernicus? When Langdon finally emerged from the coiled sculpture, he felt slightly dizzy. He retrieved the headset he had left on the floor earlier. "Winston?" he said, pulling on the device. "Hello?" A faint click, and the computerized British docent was back. "Hello, Professor. Yes, I'm here. Mr. Kirsch asked me to take you up the service elevator because time is too short to return to the atrium. He also thought you would appreciate our oversized service elevator." "Nice of him. He knows I'm claustrophobic." "Now I do too. And I will not forget it." Winston guided Langdon through the side door into a cement hallway and elevator bay. As promised, the elevator carriage was enormous, clearly designed to transport oversized artwork. "Top button," Winston said as Langdon stepped inside. "Third floor." When they arrived at their destination, Langdon stepped out. "Righto," Winston's cheery voice chimed in Langdon's head. "We'll go through the gallery on your left. It's the most direct way to the auditorium." Langdon followed Winston's directions through an expansive gallery displaying a series of bizarre art installations: a steel cannon that apparently shot gooey globs of red wax at a white wall; a wire-mesh canoe that clearly would not float; an entire miniature city made of burnished metal blocks. As they crossed the gallery toward the exit, Langdon found himself staring in utter bewilderment at a massive piece that dominated the space. It's official, he decided, I've found the strangest piece in this museum. Spanning the width of the entire room, a multitude of timber wolves were dynamically posed, sprinting in a long line across the gallery where they leaped high in the air and collided violently with a transparent glass wall, resulting in a mounting pile of dead wolves. "It's called Head On," Winston offered, unprompted. "Ninety-nine wolves racing blindly into a wall to symbolize a herd mentality, a lack of courage in diverging from the norm." The irony of the symbolism struck Langdon. I suspect Edmond will be diverging dramatically from the norm this evening. "Now, if youTl continue straight ahead," Winston said, "youTl find the exit to the left of that colorful diamond-shaped piece. The artist is one of Edmond's favorites." Langdon spotted the brightly colored painting up ahead and instantly recognized the trademark squiggles, primary colors, and playful floating eye. Joan Miro, Langdon thought, having always liked the famous Barcelonan's playful work, which felt like a cross between a child's coloring book and a surrealist stained-glass window. As Langdon drew even with the piece, however, he stopped short, startled to see that the surface was utterly smooth, with no visible brush-strokes. "It's a reproduction ?" "No, that's the original," Winston replied. Langdon looked closer. The work had clearly been printed by a large-format printer. "Winston, this is a print. It's not even on canvas." "I don't work on canvas," Winston replied. "I create art virtually, and then Edmond prints it for me." "Hold on," Langdon said in disbelief. "This is yours?" "Yes, I tried to mimic the style of Joan Miro." "I can see that," Langdon said. "You even signed it�Miro." "No," Winston said. "Look again. I signed it Miro �with no accent. In Spanish, the word miro means T look at.'" Clever, Langdon had to admit, seeing the single Miro-style eye looking at the viewer from the center of Winston's piece. "Edmond asked me to create a self-portrait, and this is what I came up with." This is your self-portrait? Langdon glanced again at the collection of uneven squiggles. You must be a very strange-looking computer. Langdon had recently read about Edmond's growing excitement for teaching computers to create algorithmic art�that is, art generated by highly complex computer programs. It raised an uncomfortable question: When a computer creates art, who is the artist�the computer or the programmer? At MIT, a recent exhibit of highly accomplished algorithmic art had put an awkward spin on the Harvard humanities course: Is Art What Makes Us Human? "I compose music too," Winston chimed. "You should ask Edmond to play some for you later, should you be curious. At the moment, however, you do need to hurry. The presentation is starting shortly." Langdon left the gallery and found himself on a high catwalk overlooking the main atrium. On the opposite side of the cavernous space, docents were hustling the last few straggling guests out of the elevators, herding them in Langdon's direction toward a doorway up ahead. "Tonight's program is scheduled to begin in just a few minutes," Winston said. "Do you see the entrance to the presentation space?" "I do. It's just ahead." "Excellent. One final point. As you enter, you will see collection bins for headsets. Edmond asked that you not return your unit, but rather keep it. This way, after the program, I will be able to guide you out of the museum through a back door, where you'll avoid the crowds and be sure to find a taxi." Langdon pictured the strange series of letters and numbers that Edmond had scrawled on the business card, telling him to give it to the taxi driver. "Winston, all Edmond wrote was �BIO-EC346.' He called it a painfully simple code." "He speaks the truth," Winston replied quickly. "Now, Professor, the program is about to begin. I do hope you enjoy Mr. Kirsch's presentation, and I look forward to assisting you afterward." With an abrupt click, Winston was gone. Langdon neared the entry doors, removed his headset, and slipped the tiny device into his jacket pocket. Then he hurried through the entrance with the last few guests just as the doors closed behind him. Once again, he found himself in an unexpected space. We're standing up for the presentation? Langdon had imagined the crowd gathering in a comfortable sit-down auditorium to hear Edmond's announcement, but instead, hundreds of guests stood packed into a cramped, whitewashed gallery space. The room contained no visible artwork and no seating�just a podium at the far wall, flanked by a large LCD screen that read: Live program begins in 2 minutes 07 seconds Langdon felt a surge of anticipation, and his eyes continued down the LCD screen to a second line of text, which he needed to read twice: Current remote attendees: 1,953,694 Two million people? Kirsch had told Langdon he would be live-streaming his announcement, but these numbers seemed unfathomable, and the ticker was climbing faster with each passing moment. A smile crossed Langdon's face. His former student had certainly done well for himself. The question now was: What in the world was Edmond about to say? CHAPTER 13 in A moonlit desert just east of Dubai, a Sand Viper 1100 dune buggy veered hard to the left and skidded to a stop, sending a veil of sand billowing out in front of the blazing headlights. The teenager behind the wheel ripped off his goggles and stared down at the object he had almost run over. Apprehensive, he climbed out of the vehicle and approached the dark form in the sand. Sure enough, it was exactly what it had appeared to be. There in his headlights, sprawled facedown on the sand, lay a motionless human body. "Marhaba?" the kid called out. "Hello?" No response. The boy could tell it was a man from his clothing�a traditional chechia hat and loose-fitting thawb �and the man looked well fed and squat. His footprints had long since blown away, as had any tire tracks or hints as to how he might have gotten this far out into the open desert. "Marhaba?" the kid repeated. Nothing. Uncertain what else to do, the boy reached out with his foot and gently nudged the man's side. Although his body was plump, his flesh felt taut and hard, already desiccated by the wind and sun. Definitely dead. The boy reached down, grasped the man's shoulder, and heaved him onto his back. The man's lifeless eyes stared up at the heavens. His face and beard were covered in sand, but even dirty, he looked friendly somehow, even familiar, like a favorite uncle or grandfather. The roar of a half-dozen quad bikes and buggies thundered nearby as the kid's dune-bashing buddies circled back to make sure he was all right. Their vehicles roared up over the ridge and slid down the face of the dune. Everyone parked, removed their goggles and helmets, and gathered around the macabre discovery of a parched corpse. One of the boys started speaking excitedly, having recognized the dead man as the famous allamah Syed al-Fadl �a scholar and religious leader�who spoke from time to time at the university. "Matha Alayna �an naf'al?" he asked aloud. What should we do? The boys stood in a circle, staring silently at the corpse. Then they reacted like teenagers around the world. They pulled out their phones and began snapping photos to text to their friends. CHAPTER 14 standing shoulder to shoulder with guests jostling around the podium, Robert Langdon watched in amazement as the number on the LCD screen ticked steadily higher. Current remote attendees: 2,527,664 The background chatter in the cramped space had risen to the level of a dull roar, the voices of hundreds of guests buzzing with anticipation, many making excited last-minute phone calls or tweeting their whereabouts. A technician stepped to the podium and tapped the microphone. "Ladies and gentlemen, we asked earlier that you please turn off your mobile devices. At this time, we will be blocking all Wi-Fi and cellular communications for the duration of this event." Many guests were still on their phones, and they abruptly lost their connections. Most of them looked wholly stupefied, as if they had just witnessed some miraculous piece of Kirschian technology capable of magically severing all connection with the outside world. Five hundred dollars at an electronics store, Langdon knew, being one of several Harvard professors who now used portable cell-jamming technology to render their lecture halls "dead zones" and keep students off their devices during class. A cameraman now moved into position with a massive camera on his shoulder, which he directed at the podium. The room lights dimmed. The LCD screen read: Live program begins in 38 seconds Current remote attendees: 2,857,914 Langdon watched the attendee counter with amazement. It seemed to be climbing faster than the U.S. national debt, and he found it nearly impossible to fathom that close to three million people were sitting at home at this very moment watching a live stream of what was about to happen in this room. "Thirty seconds," the technician announced softly into the microphone. A narrow door opened in the wall behind the podium, and the crowd immediately hushed, all looking expectantly for the great Edmond Kirsch. But Edmond never materialized. The door stood open for nearly ten seconds. Then an elegant woman emerged and moved toward the podium. She was strikingly beautiful�tall and willowy with long black hair�wearing a formfitting white dress with a diagonal black stripe. She seemed to drift effortlessly across the floor. Taking center stage, she adjusted the microphone, took a deep breath, and gave the attendees a patient smile as she waited for the clock to tick down. Live program begins in 10 seconds The woman closed her eyes a moment, as if to gather herself, and then she opened them again, a portrait of poise. The cameraman held up five fingers. Four, three, two ... The room fell completely silent as the woman raised her eyes to the camera. The LCD display dissolved into a live image of her face. She fixed the audience with spirited dark eyes as she casually brushed a strand of hair from her olive- toned cheek. "Good evening, everyone," she began, her voice cultured and gracious, with a light Spanish accent. "My name is Ambra Vidal." An unusually loud burst of applause erupted in the room, making it apparent that a good number of people knew who she was. "\Felicidades!" someone shouted. Congratulations! The woman blushed, and Langdon sensed there was some piece of information he was missing. "Ladies and gentlemen," she said, quickly pressing on, "for the past five years, I have been the director of this Guggenheim Museum Bilbao, and I am here tonight to welcome you to an incredibly special evening presented by a truly remarkable man." The crowd applauded enthusiastically, and Langdon joined them. "Edmond Kirsch is not only a generous patron of this museum, but he has become a trusted friend. It has been a privilege and a personal honor for me to have been able to work so closely with him over the past few months to plan the events of this evening. I've just checked, and social media is buzzing around the world! As many of you have no doubt heard by now, Edmond Kirsch is planning to make a major scientific announcement tonight�a discovery that he believes will be forever remembered as his greatest contribution to the world." A murmur of excitement shot through the room. The dark-haired woman smiled playfully. "Of course, I begged Edmond to tell me what he had discovered, but he refused to give even a hint." A round of laughter was followed by more applause. "Tonight's special event," she continued, "will be presented in English�Mr. Kirsch's native language�although for those of you attending virtually, we are offering real-time translation in more than twenty languages." The LCD screen refreshed, and Ambra added, "And if anyone ever doubted Edmond's self-confidence, here is the automated press release that went out fifteen minutes ago to social media around the globe." Langdon eyed the LCD screen. Tonight: Live. 20:00 hours CEST Futurist Edmond Kirsch to announce discovery that will change the face of science forever. So that's how you get three million viewers in a matter of minutes, Langdon mused. As he returned his attention to the podium, Langdon spotted two people he had not noticed earlier�a pair of stone-faced security guards standing at full attention against the sidewall, scanning the crowd. Langdon was surprised to see the monogrammed initials on their matching blue blazers. The Guardia Real?! What is the king's Royal Guard doing here tonight? It seemed unlikely that any member of the royal family would be in attendance; as staunch Catholics, the royals would almost certainly eschew public association with an atheist like Edmond Kirsch. The king of Spain, as a parliamentary monarch, held very limited official power, and yet he retained enormous influence over the hearts and minds of his people. For millions of Spaniards, the crown still stood as a symbol of the rich Catholic tradition of los reyes catolicos and Spain's Golden Age. The Royal Palace of Madrid still shone as a spiritual compass and monument to a long history of stalwart religious conviction. Langdon had heard it said in Spain: "Parliament rules, but the king reigns." For centuries, the kings who had presided over Spain's diplomatic affairs had all been deeply devout, conservative Catholics. And the current king is no exception, Langdon thought, having read of the man's deep religious convictions and conservative values. In recent months, the aging monarch was reported to be bedridden and dying, with his country now preparing for the eventual transition of power to his only son, Julian. According to the press, Prince Julian was something of an unknown quantity, having lived quietly in the long shadow of his father, and now the country was wondering what kind of ruler he would turn out to be. Did Prince Julian send Guardia agents to scout Edmond's event? Langdon flashed again on Edmond's threatening voice mail from Bishop Valdespino. Despite Langdon's concerns, he sensed the atmosphere in the room was amiable, enthusiastic, and safe. He recalled Edmond telling him that tonight's security was incredibly tight�so perhaps Spain's Guardia Real was an additional layer of protection to ensure that the evening went smoothly. "For those of you who are familiar with Edmond Kirsch's passion for the dramatic," Ambra Vidal continued, "you know he would never plan to have us stand in this sterile room for long." She motioned to a set of closed double doors on the far side of the room. "Through those doors, Edmond Kirsch has constructed an �experiential space' in which to present his dynamic multimedia presentation tonight. It is fully automated by computers and will be streamed live around the entire world." She paused to check her gold watch. "Tonight's event is carefully timed, and Edmond has asked that I get you all inside so we can begin precisely at eight fifteen, which is only minutes away." She pointed to the double doors. "So if you would, ladies and gentlemen, please move inside, and we will see what the amazing Edmond Kirsch has in store for us." On cue, the double doors swung open. Langdon peered beyond them, expecting to see another gallery. Instead, he found himself startled by what lay beyond. Through the doors, there appeared to be a deep dark tunnel. Admiral Avila hung back as throngs of guests began jostling excitedly toward the dimly lit passageway. As he peered into the tunnel, he was pleased to see that the space beyond was dark. Darkness would make his task a great deal easier. Touching the rosary beads in his pocket, he gathered his thoughts, going over the details he had just been given regarding his mission. Timing will be critical. CHAPTER 15 fashioned of black fabric that was stretched across supportive arches, the tunnel was about twenty feet wide and sloped gently upward to the left. The tunnel floor was covered with plush black carpet, and two strands of strip lighting along the base of the walls provided the only illumination. "Shoes, please," a docent whispered to the new arrivals. "Everyone please remove your shoes, and carry them with you." Langdon stepped out of his patent-leather dress shoes, and his stocking feet sank deep into the remarkably soft carpet. He felt his body relax instinctively. All around him, he heard appreciative sighs. As he padded farther down the passage, Langdon finally saw the end�a black curtain barrier where guests were being greeted by docents who handed each of them what appeared to be a thick beach towel before ushering them through the curtain. Inside the tunnel, the earlier buzz of anticipation had now dissolved into uncertain silence. As Langdon arrived at the curtain, a docent handed him a folded piece of fabric, which he realized was not a beach towel but rather a small plush blanket with a pillow sewn into one end. Langdon thanked the docent and stepped through the curtain into the space beyond. Lor the second time tonight, he was forced to stop in his tracks. Although Langdon could not say what he had imagined he would see beyond the curtain, it most certainly was nothing close to the scene now before him. Are we ... outdoors? Langdon was standing on the edge of an expansive field. Above him stretched a dazzling sky of stars, and in the distance, a slender crescent moon was just rising behind a lone maple tree. Crickets chirped and a warm breeze caressed his face, the wafting air thick with the earthy scent of freshly cut grass beneath his stocking feet. "Sir?" a docent whispered, taking his arm and guiding him into the field. "Please find a space here on the grass. Lay out your blanket, and enjoy." Langdon padded out into the field along with the other equally flabbergasted guests, most of whom were now choosing spots on the vast lawn to spread out their blankets. The manicured grassy area was about the size of a hockey rink and bounded all around by trees, fescue, and cattails, which rustled in the breeze. It had taken Langdon several moments to realize this was all an illusion�a tremendous work of art. Em inside an elaborate planetarium, he thought, marveling at the impeccable attention to detail. The star-filled sky above was a projection, complete with a moon, scudding clouds, and distant rolling hills. The rustling trees and grasses were truly there� either superb fakes or a small forest of living plants in concealed pots. This nebulous perimeter of vegetation cleverly disguised the enormous room's hard edges, giving the impression of a natural environment. Langdon crouched down and felt the grass, which was soft and lifelike, but entirely dry. He'd read about the new synthetic turfs that were fooling even professional athletes, and yet Kirsch had gone a step further and created slightly uneven ground, with small swales and mounds as in a real meadow. Langdon recalled the first time he had been fooled by his senses. He was a child in a small boat drifting through a moonlit harbor where a pirate ship was engaged in a deafening cannon battle. Langdon's young mind had been incapable of accepting that he was not in a harbor at all, but in fact he was in a cavernous underground theater that had been flooded with water to create this illusion for the classic Disney World ride Pirates of the Caribbean. Tonight, the effect was staggeringly realistic, and as the guests around him took it in, Langdon could see that their wonder and delight mirrored his own. He had to give Edmond credit�not so much for creating this amazing illusion, but for persuading hundreds of adults to kick off their fancy shoes, lie down on the lawn, and gaze up at the heavens. We used to do this as kids, but somewhere along the way, we stopped. Langdon reclined and placed his head on the pillow, letting his body melt into the soft grass. Overhead, the stars twinkled, and for an instant, Langdon was a teenager again, lying on the lush fairways of the Bald Peak golf course at midnight with his best friend, pondering the mysteries of life. With a little luck, Langdon mused, Edmond Kirsch might solve some of those mysteries for us tonight. At the rear of the theater, Admiral Luis Avila took one final survey of the room and moved silently backward, slipping out unseen through the same curtain through which he had just entered. Alone in the entry tunnel, he ran a hand along the fabric walls until he located a seam. As quietly as possible, he pulled apart the Velcro closure, stepped through the wall, and resealed the cloth behind him. All illusions evaporated. Avila was no longer standing in a meadow. He was in an enormous rectangular space that was dominated by a sprawling oval-shaped bubble. A room built within a room. The construction before him�a domed theater of sorts�was surrounded by a towering exoskeleton of scaffolding that supported a tangle of cables, lights, and audio speakers. Pointing inward, a shimmering array of video projectors glowed in unison, casting wide beams of light downward onto the translucent surface of the dome, and creating the illusion within of a starlit sky and rolling hills. Avila admired Kirsch's knack for drama, although the futurist could never have imagined just how dramatic his night would soon turn out to be. Remember what is at stake. You are a soldier in a noble war. Part of a greater whole. Avila had rehearsed this mission in his mind numerous times. He reached into his pocket and pulled out the oversized rosary beads. At that moment, from an overhead bank of speakers inside the dome, a man's voice thundered down like the voice of God. "Good evening, friends. My name is Edmond Kirsch." CHAPTER 16 in Budapest, rabbi Koves paced nervously in the dim light of his haziko study. Clutching his TV remote, he flipped anxiously through the channels as he awaited further news from Bishop Valdespino. On television, several news channels had interrupted their regular programming during the past ten minutes to carry the live feed coming out of the Guggenheim. Commentators were discussing Kirsch's accomplishments and speculating about his mysterious upcoming announcement. Koves cringed at the snowballing level of interest. I have seen this announcement already. Three days ago, on the mountain of Montserrat, Edmond Kirsch had previewed an alleged "rough-cut" version for Koves, al-Fadl, and Valdespino. Now, Koves suspected, the world was about to see the same exact program. Tonight everything will change, he thought sadly. The phone rang and jolted Koves from his contemplation. He seized the handset. Valdespino began without preamble. "Yehuda, I'm afraid I have some more bad news." In a somber voice, he conveyed a bizarre report that was now coming out of the United Arab Emirates. Koves covered his mouth in horror. "Allamah al-Fadl ... committed suicide?" "That is what the authorities are speculating. He was found a short time ago, deep in the desert ... as if he had simply walked out there to die." Valdespino paused. "All I can guess is that the strain of the last few days was too much for him." Koves considered the possibility, feeling a wave of heartbreak and confusion. He too had been struggling with the implications of Kirsch's discovery, and yet the idea that Allamah al-Fadl would kill himself in despair seemed wholly unlikely. "Something is wrong here," Koves declared. "I don't believe he would do such a thing." Valdespino fell silent for a long time. "I'm glad you said that," he finally agreed. "I have to admit, I too find it quite difficult to accept that this was a suicide." "Then ... who could be responsible?" "Anyone who wanted Edmond Kirsch's discovery to remain a secret," the bishop replied quickly. "Someone who believed, as we did, that his announcement was still weeks away." "But Kirsch said nobody else knew about the discovery!" Koves argued. "Only you, Allamah al-Fadl, and myself." "Maybe Kirsch lied about that too. But even if the three of us are the only ones he told, don't forget how desperately our friend Syed al-Fadl wanted to go public. It's possible that the allamah shared information about Kirsch's discovery with a colleague in the Emirates. And maybe that colleague believed, as I do, that Kirsch's discovery would have dangerous repercussions." "Implying what?" the rabbi demanded angrily. "That an associate of al-Fadl killed him in order to keep this quiet? That's ridiculous!" "Rabbi," the bishop replied calmly, "I certainly don't know what happened. I'm only trying to imagine answers, as you are." Koves exhaled. "I'm sorry. I'm still trying to absorb the news of Syed's death." "As am I. And if Syed was murdered for what he knew, then we need to be careful ourselves. It is possible that you and I are also targeted." Koves considered this. "Once the news goes public, we are irrelevant." "True, but it is not yet public." "Your Grace, the announcement is only minutes away. Every station is carrying it." "Yes ..." Valdespino let out a tired sigh. "It seems I'll have to accept that my prayers have gone unanswered." Koves wondered if the bishop had literally prayed for God to intervene and change Kirsch's mind. "Even when this goes public," Valdespino said, "we are not safe. I suspect Kirsch will take great pleasure in telling the world that he consulted with religious leaders three days ago. I'm now wondering if an appearance of ethical transparency was his true motive for calling the meeting. And if he mentions us by name, well, you and I will become the focus of intense scrutiny and perhaps even criticism from our own flocks, who might believe we should have taken action. I'm sorry, I'm just ..." The bishop hesitated as if he had something more he wanted to say. "What is it?" Koves pressed. "We can discuss it later. I'll phone you again after we witness how Kirsch handles his presentation. Until then, please stay inside. Lock your doors. Speak to nobody. And be safe." "You're worrying me, Antonio." "I don't mean to," Valdespino replied. "All we can do is wait and see how the world reacts. This is in God's hands now." CHAPTER 17 the breezy meadow inside the Guggenheim Museum had grown quiet after Edmond Kirsch's voice boomed down from the heavens. Hundreds of guests were reclined on blankets, gazing up into a dazzling sky of stars. Robert Langdon lay near the center of the field, caught up in the growing anticipation. "Tonight, let us be children again," Kirsch's voice continued. "Let us lie out beneath the stars, with our minds wide open to all possibilities." Langdon could feel the excitement rippling through the crowd. "Tonight, let us be like the early explorers," Kirsch declared, "those who left everything behind and set out across vast oceans ... those who first glimpsed a land that had never before been seen ... those who fell to their knees in awestruck realization that the world was far greater than their philosophies had dared imagine. Their long-held beliefs about their world disintegrated in the face of new discovery. This will be our mind-set tonight." Impressive, Langdon mused, curious if Edmond's narration was pre-recorded or whether Kirsch himself was backstage somewhere reading from a script. "My friends"�Edmond's voice resounded above them�"we have all gathered tonight to hear news of an important discovery. I ask your indulgence in allowing me to set the stage. Tonight, as with all shifts in human philosophy, it is critical we understand the historical context into which a moment like this is born." Thunder rolled in the distance, right on cue. Langdon could feel the deep bass from the audio speakers rumbling in his gut. "To help us get acclimated tonight," Edmond continued, "we are very fortunate to have with us a celebrated scholar�a legend in the world of symbols, codes, history, religion, and art. He is also a dear friend. Ladies and gentlemen, please welcome Harvard University professor Robert Langdon." Langdon jolted up onto his elbows as the crowd clapped enthusiastically and the stars overhead dissolved into a wide-angle shot of a large auditorium packed with people. Onstage, Langdon paced back and forth in his Harris Tweed jacket before a rapt audience. So this is the role that Edmond mentioned, he thought, settling back uneasily into the grass. "Early humans," Langdon lectured on-screen, "had a relationship of wonder with their universe, especially with those phenomena they could not rationally understand. To solve these mysteries, they created a vast pantheon of gods and goddesses to explain anything that was beyond their understanding�thunder, tides, earthquakes, volcanoes, infertility, plagues, even love." This is surreal, Langdon thought, lying on his back and staring up at himself. "For the early Greeks, the ebb and flow of the ocean was attributed to the shifting moods of Poseidon." On the ceiling, the image of Langdon dissolved, but his voice continued to narrate. Images of pounding ocean surf materialized, shaking the entire room. Langdon watched in wonder as the crashing waves morphed into a desolate wind-whipped tundra of snowdrifts. From somewhere, a cold wind blew across the meadow. "The seasonal change to winter," Langdon's voice-over continued, "was caused by the planet's sadness at Persephone's annual abduction into the underworld." Now the air grew warm again, and from out of the frozen landscape, a mountain rose, climbing higher and higher, its peak erupting with sparks, smoke, and lava. "For the Romans," Langdon narrated, "volcanoes were believed to be the home of Vulcan�blacksmith to the gods�who worked in a giant forge beneath the mountain, causing flames to spew out of his chimney." Langdon smelled a passing whiff of sulfur, and was amazed at how ingeniously Edmond had transformed Langdon's lecture into a multisensory experience. The rumbling of the volcano abruptly stopped. In the silence, crickets began chirping again, and a warm grassy breeze blew across the meadow. "The ancients invented countless gods," Langdon's voice explained, "to explain not only the mysteries of their planet, but also the mysteries of their own bodies." Overhead, the twinkling constellations of stars reappeared, now superimposed with line drawings of the various gods they represented. "Infertility was caused by falling out of favor with the goddess Juno. Love was the result of being targeted by Eros. Epidemics were explained as a punishment sent by Apollo." New constellations now lit up along with images of new gods. "If you've read my books," Langdon's voice continued, "you will have heard me use the term �God of the Gaps.' That is to say, when the ancients experienced gaps in their understanding of the world around them, they filled those gaps with God." The sky filled now with a massive collage of paintings and statues depicting dozens of ancient deities. "Countless gods filled countless gaps," Langdon said. "And yet, over the centuries, scientific knowledge increased." A collage of mathematical and technical symbols flooded the sky overhead. "As the gaps in our understanding of the natural world gradually disappeared, our pantheon of gods began to shrink." On the ceiling, the image of Poseidon came to the forefront. "For example, when we learned that the tides were caused by lunar cycles, Poseidon was no longer necessary, and we banished him as a foolish myth of an unenlightened time." The image of Poseidon evaporated in a puff of smoke. "As you know, the same fate befell all the gods�dying off, one by one, as they outlived their relevance to our evolving intellects." Overhead, the images of gods began twinkling out, one by one�gods of thunder, earthquakes, plagues, and on and on. As the number of images dwindled, Langdon added, "But make no mistake about it. These gods did not �go gentle into that good night'; it is a messy process for a culture to abandon its deities. Spiritual beliefs are etched deeply on our psyches at a young age by those we love and trust most�our parents, our teachers, our religious leaders. Therefore, any religious shifts occur over generations, and not without great angst, and often bloodshed." The sound of clattering swords and shouting now accompanied the gradual disappearance of the gods, whose images winked out one by one. Finally, the image of a single god remained�an iconic wizened face with a flowing white beard. "Zeus ...," Langdon declared, his voice powerful. "The god of all gods. The most feared and revered of all the pagan deities. Zeus, more than any other god, resisted his own extinction, mounting a violent battle against the dying of his own light, precisely as had the earlier gods Zeus had replaced." On the ceiling flashed images of Stonehenge, the Sumerian cuneiform tablets, and the Great Pyramids of Egypt. Then Zeus's bust returned. "Zeus's followers were so resistant to giving up on their god that the conquering faith of Christianity had no choice but to adopt the face of Zeus as the face of their new God." On the ceiling, the bearded bust of Zeus dissolved seamlessly into a fresco of an identical bearded face�that of the Christian God as depicted in Michelangelo's Creation of Adam on the ceiling of the Sistine Chapel. "Today, we no longer believe in stories like those about Zeus�a boy raised by a goat and given power by one-eyed creatures called Cyclopes. For us, with the benefit of modern thinking, these tales have all been classified as mythology� quaint fictional stories that give us an entertaining glimpse into our superstitious past." The ceiling now showed a photo of a dusty library shelf, where leather-bound tomes on ancient mythology languished in the dark beside books on nature worship, Baal, Inana, Osiris, and innumerable early theologies. "Things are different now!" Langdon's deep voice declared. "We are the Moderns." In the sky, fresh images appeared�crisp and sparkling photographs of space exploration ... computer chips ... a medical lab ... a particle accelerator ... soaring jets. "We are an intellectually evolved and technologically skilled people. We do not believe in giant blacksmiths working under volcanoes or in gods that control the tides or seasons. We are nothing like our ancient ancestors." Or are we ? Langdon whispered inwardly, mouthing along with the playback. "Or are we?" Langdon intoned overhead. "We consider ourselves modern rational individuals, and yet our species' most widespread religion includes a whole host of magical claims�humans inexplicably rising from the dead, miraculous virgin births, vengeful gods that send plagues and floods, mystical promises of an afterlife in cloud-swept heavens or fiery hells." As Langdon spoke, the ceiling flashed well-known Christian images of the Resurrection, the Virgin Mary, Noah's Ark, the parting of the Red Sea, heaven, and hell. "So just for a moment," Langdon said, "let us imagine the reaction of humankind's future historians and anthropologists. With the benefit of perspective, will they look back on our religious beliefs and categorize them as the mythologies of an unenlightened time? Will they look at our gods as we look at Zeus? Will they collect our sacred scriptures and banish them to that dusty bookshelf of history?" The question hung in the darkness for a long moment. And then, abruptly, Edmond Kirsch's voice broke the silence. "YES, Professor," the futurist boomed from on high. "I believe all of that will happen. I believe future generations will ask themselves how a technologically advanced species like ours could possibly believe most of what our modern religions teach us." Kirsch's voice grew stronger as a new series of images splashed across the ceiling�Adam and Eve, a woman shrouded in a burka, a Hindu firewalk. "I believe future generations will look at our current traditions," Kirsch declared, "and conclude that we lived during an unenlightened time. As evidence, they will point to our beliefs that we were divinely created in a magical garden, or that our omnipotent Creator demands that women cover their heads, or that we risk burning our own bodies to honor our gods." More images appeared�a fast-moving montage of photographs depicting religious ceremonies from around the world�from exorcisms and baptisms to body piercing and animal sacrifices. The slide show concluded with a deeply unsettling video of an Indian cleric dangling a tiny infant over the edge of a fifty-foot tower. Suddenly the cleric let go, and the child plummeted fifty feet, straight down into an outstretched blanket, which joyful villagers held like a fireman's net. The Grishneshwar Temple drop, Langdon thought, recalling that it was believed by some to bring God's favor to a child. Thankfully, the disturbing video came to an end. In total darkness now, Kirsch's voice resonated overhead. "How can it be that the modern human mind is capable of precise logical analysis, and yet simultaneously permits us to accept religious beliefs that should crumble beneath even the slightest rational scrutiny?" Overhead, the brilliant sky of stars returned. "As it turns out," Edmond concluded, "the answer is quite simple." The stars in the sky grew suddenly brighter and more substantial. Strands of connecting fiber appeared, running between the stars to form a seemingly infinite web of interconnected nodes. Neurons, Langdon realized just as Edmond began to speak. "The human brain," Edmond declared. "Why does it believe what it believes?" Overhead, several nodes flashed, sending pulses of electricity through the fibers to other neurons. "Like an organic computer," Edmond continued, "your brain has an operating system�a series of rules that organizes and defines all of the chaotic input that flows in all day long�language, a catchy tune, a siren, the taste of chocolate. As you can imagine, the stream of incoming information is frenetically diverse and relentless, and your brain must make sense of it all. In fact, it is the very programming of your brain's operating system that defines your perception of reality. Unfortunately, the joke's on us, because whoever wrote the program for the human brain had a twisted sense of humor. In other words, it's not our fault that we believe the crazy things we believe." The synapses overhead sizzled, and familiar images bubbled up from within the brain: astrological charts; Jesus walking on water; Scientology founder L. Ron Hubbard; the Egyptian god Osiris; Hinduism's four-armed elephant god, Ganesha; and a marble statue of the Virgin Mary weeping literal tears. "And so as a programmer, I have to ask myself: What kind of bizarre operating system would create such illogical output? If we could look into the human mind and read its operating system, we would find something like this." Four words appeared in giant text overhead. DESPISE CHAOS. CREATE ORDER. "This is our brain's root program," Edmond said. "And therefore, this is exactly how humans are inclined. Against chaos. And in favor of order." The room trembled suddenly with a cacophony of discordant piano notes, as if a child were banging on a keyboard. Langdon and those around him tensed involuntarily. Edmond yelled over the clamor. "The sound of someone banging randomly on a piano is unbearable! And yet, if we take those same notes and arrange them in a better order ..." The haphazard din immediately halted, supplanted by the soothing melody of Debussy's "Clair de lune." Langdon felt his muscles relax, and the tension in the room seemed to evaporate. "Our brains rejoice," Edmond said. "Same notes. Same instrument. But Debussy creates order. And it is this same rejoicing in the creation of order that prompts humans to assemble jigsaw puzzles or straighten paintings on a wall. Our predisposition to organization is written into our DNA, and so it should come as no surprise to us that the greatest invention the human mind has created is the computer�a machine designed specifically to help us create order out of chaos. In fact, the word in Spanish for computer is ordenador �quite literally, �that which creates order."' The image of a massive supercomputer appeared, with a young man sitting at its lone terminal. "Just imagine you have a powerful computer with access to all of the information in the world. You are permitted to ask this computer any questions you like. Probability suggests you would eventually ask one of two fundamental questions that have captivated humans since we first became self-aware." The man typed into the terminal, and text appeared. Where do we come from? Where are we going? "In other words," Edmond said, "you would ask about our origin and our destiny. And when you ask those questions, this would be the computer's response." The terminal flashed: INSUFFICIENT DATA FOR ACCURATE RESPONSE. "Not very helpful," Kirsch said, "but at least it's honest." Now an image of a human brain appeared. "However, if you ask this little biological computer�Where do we come from?�something else happens." From out of the brain flowed a stream of religious images�God reaching out to infuse Adam with life, Prometheus crafting a primordial human out of mud, Brahma creating humans from different parts of his own body, an African god parting the clouds and lowering two humans to earth, a Norse god fashioning a man and a woman out of driftwood. "And now you ask," Edmond said, "Where are we going?" More images flowed from the brain�pristine heavens, fiery hells, hieroglyphs of the Egyptian Book of the Dead, stone carvings of astral projections, Greek renderings of the Elysian Fields, Kabbalistic descriptions of Gilgul neshamot, diagrams of reincarnation from Buddhism and Hinduism, the Theosophical circles of the Summerland. "For the human brain," Edmond explained, "any answer is better than no answer. We feel enormous discomfort when faced with �insufficient data,' and so our brains invent the data�offering us, at the very least, the illusion of order� creating myriad philosophies, mythologies, and religions to reassure us that there is indeed an order and structure to the unseen world." As the religious images continued to flow, Edmond spoke with increasing intensity. "Where do we come from? Where are we going? These fundamental questions of human existence have always obsessed me, and for years I've dreamed of finding the answers." Edmond paused, his tone turning somber. "Tragically, on account of religious dogma, millions of people believe they already know the answers to these big questions. And because not every religion offers the same answers, entire cultures end up warring over whose answers are correct, and which version of God's story is the One True Story." The screen overhead erupted with images of gunfire and exploding mortar shells�a violent montage of photos depicting religious wars, followed by images of sobbing refugees, displaced families, and civilian corpses. "Since the beginning of religious history, our species has been caught in a never-ending cross fire�atheists, Christians, Muslims, Jews, Hindus, the faithful of all religions�and the only thing that unites us all is our deep longing for peace" The thundering images of war vanished and were replaced by the silent sky of glimmering stars. "Just imagine what would happen if we miraculously learned the answers to life's big questions ... if we all suddenly glimpsed the same unmistakable proof and realized we had no choice but to open our arms and accept it ... together, as a species." The image of a priest appeared on the screen, his eyes closed in prayer. "Spiritual inquiry has always been the realm of religion, which encourages us to have blind faith in its teachings, even when they make little logical sense." A collage of images depicting fervent believers now appeared, all with eyes closed, singing, bowing, chanting, praying. "But faith," Edmond declared, "by its very definition, requires placing your trust in something that is unseeable and indefinable, accepting as fact something for which there exists no empirical evidence. And so, understandably, we all end up placing our faith in different things because there is no universal truth." He paused. "However ..." The images on the ceiling dissolved into a single photograph, of a female student, eyes wide open and intense, staring down into a microscope. "Science is the antithesis of faith," Kirsch continued. "Science, by definition, is the attempt to find physical proof for that which is unknown or not yet defined, and to reject superstition and misperception in favor of observable facts. When science offers an answer, that answer is universal. Humans do not go to war over it; they rally around it." The screen now played historical footage from labs at NASA, CERN, and elsewhere�where scientists of various races all leaped up in shared joy and embraced as new pieces of information were unveiled. "My friends," Edmond now whispered, "I have made many predictions in my life. And I am going to make another one tonight." He took a long slow breath. "The age of religion is drawing to a close," he said, "and the age of science is dawning." A hush fell over the room. "And tonight, mankind is about to make a quantum leap in that direction." The words sent an unexpected chill through Langdon. Whatever this mysterious discovery turned out to be, Edmond was clearly setting the stage for a major showdown between himself and the religions of the world. CHAPTER 18 ConspiracyNet.com EDMOND KIRSCH UPDATE A FUTURE WITHOUT RELIGION? In a live stream currently reaching an unprecedented three million online viewers, futurist Edmond Kirsch appears poised to announce a scientific discovery that he hints will answer two of humanity's most enduring questions. After an enticing prerecorded introduction by Harvard professor Robert Langdon, Edmond Kirsch has launched into a hard-hitting critique of religious belief in which he has just made the bold prediction, "The age of religion is drawing to a close." So far tonight, the well-known atheist appears to be a bit more restrained and respectful than usual. For a collection of Kirsch's past antireligious rants, click here . CHAPTER 19 just outside the fabric wall of the domed theater, Admiral Avila moved into position, hidden from view by a maze of scaffolding. By staying low, he had kept his shadow hidden and was now ensconced only inches from the outer skin of the wall near the front of the auditorium. Silently, he reached into his pocket and removed the rosary beads. Timing will be critical. Inching his hands along the string of beads, he found the heavy metal crucifix, amused that the guards manning the metal detectors downstairs had let this object slip past them without a second glance. Using a razor blade hidden in the stem of the crucifix, Admiral Avila cut a six-inch vertical slit in the fabric wall. Gently, he parted the opening and peered through into another world�a wooded field where hundreds of guests were reclining on blankets and staring up at the stars. They cannot imagine what is coming. Avila was pleased to see that the two Guardia Real agents had taken up positions on the opposite side of the field, near the right front corner of the auditorium. They stood at rigid attention, nestled discreetly in the shadows of some trees. In the dim light, they would be unable to see Avila until it was too late. Near the guards, the only other person standing was museum director Ambra Vidal, who seemed to be shifting uncomfortably as she watched Kirsch's presentation. Contented with his position, Avila closed the slit and refocused his attention on his crucifix. Like most crosses, it had two short arms that made up the transverse bar. On this cross, however, the arms were magnetically attached to the vertical stem and could be removed. Avila grabbed one of the cruciform's arms and forcefully bent it. The piece came off in his hand, and a small object fell out. Avila did the same on the other side, leaving the crucifix armless�now just a rectangle of metal on a heavy chain. He slid the beaded chain back into his pocket for safekeeping. I'll need this shortly. He now focused on the two small objects that had been hidden inside the arms of the cross. Two short-range bullets. Avila reached behind him, fishing under his belt, pulling from the small of his back the object he had smuggled in beneath his suit jacket. Several years had passed since an American kid named Cody Wilson had designed "The Liberator"�the first 3-D-printed polymer gun�and the technology had improved exponentially. The new ceramic and polymer firearms still did not have much power, but what they lacked in range, they more than made up for by being invisible to metal detectors. All I need to do is get close. If all went as planned, his current location would be perfect. The Regent had somehow gained inside information about the precise layout and sequence of events this evening ... and he had made it very clear how Avila's mission should be carried out. The results would be brutal, but having now witnessed Edmond Kirsch's Godless preamble, Avila felt confident that his sins here tonight would be forgiven. Our enemies are waging war, the Regent had told him. We must either kill or be killed. Standing against the far wall in the right front corner of the auditorium, Ambra Vidal hoped she did not look as uncomfortable as she felt. Edmond told me this was a scientific program. The American futurist had never been shy about his distaste for religion, but Ambra had never imagined tonight's presentation would display such hostility. Edmond refused to let me preview it. There would certainly be fallout with the museum board members, but Ambra's concerns right now were far more personal. A couple of weeks ago, Ambra had confided in a very influential man about her involvement in tonight's event. The man had strongly urged her not to participate. He had warned of the dangers of blindly hosting a presentation without any knowledge of its content�especially when it was produced by the well-known iconoclast Edmond Kirsch. He practically ordered me to cancel, she remembered. But his self-righteous tone made me too incensed to listen. Now, as Ambra stood alone beneath the star-filled sky, she wondered if that man was sitting somewhere watching this live stream, his head in his hands. Of course he is watching, she thought. The real question is: Will he lash out? Inside Almudena Cathedral, Bishop Valdespino was sitting rigidly at his desk, eyes glued to his laptop. He had no doubt that everyone in the nearby Royal Palace was also watching this program, especially Prince Julian�the next in line for the throne of Spain. The prince must be ready to explode. Tonight, one of Spain's most respected museums was collaborating with a prominent American atheist to broadcast what religious pundits were already calling a "blasphemous, anti-Christian publicity stunt." Further fanning the flames of controversy, the museum director hosting tonight's event was one of Spain's newest and most visible celebrities�the spectacularly beautiful Ambra Vidal�a woman who for the past two months had dominated Spanish headlines and enjoyed the overnight adoration of an entire country. Incredibly, Ms. Vidal had chosen to put everything at risk by hosting tonight's full-scale attack on God. Prince Julian will have no choice but to comment. His impending role as Spain's sovereign Catholic figurehead would be only a small part of the challenge he would face in dealing with tonight's event. Of substantially greater concern was that just last month, Prince Julian had made a joyous declaration that launched Ambra Vidal into the national spotlight. He had announced their engagement to be married. CHAPTER 20 Robert langdon was feeling uneasy about the direction of this evening's event. Edmond's presentation was skating dangerously close to becoming a public denunciation of faith in general. Langdon wondered if Edmond had somehow forgotten that he was speaking not only to the group of agnostic scientists in this room, but also to the millions of people around the globe who were watching online. Clearly, his presentation was devised to ignite controversy. Langdon was troubled by his own appearance in the program, and although Edmond certainly meant the video as a tribute, Langdon had been an involuntary flash point for religious controversy in the past ... and he preferred not to repeat the experience. Kirsch, however, had mounted a premeditated audiovisual assault on religion, and Langdon was now starting to rethink his nonchalant dismissal of the voice mail Edmond had received from Bishop Valdespino. Edmond's voice again filled the room, the visuals dissolving overhead into a collage of religious symbols from around the world. "I must admit," Edmond's voice declared, "I have had reservations about tonight's announcement, and particularly about how it might affect people of faith." He paused. "And so, three days ago, I did something a bit out of character for me. In an effort to show respect to religious viewpoints, and to gauge how my discovery might be received by people of various faiths, I quietly consulted with three prominent religious leaders�scholars of Islam, Christanity, and Judaism�and I shared with them my discovery." Hushed murmurs echoed throughout the room. "As I expected, all three men reacted with profound surprise, concern, and, yes, even anger, at what I revealed to them. And while their reactions were negative, I want to thank them for graciously meeting with me. I will do them the courtesy of not revealing their names, but I do want to address them directly tonight and thank them for not attempting to interfere with this presentation." He paused. "God knows, they could have." Langdon listened, amazed at how deftly Edmond was walking a thin line and covering his bases. Edmond's decision to meet with religious leaders suggested an open-mindedness, trust, and impartiality for which the futurist was not generally known. The meeting at Montserrat, Langdon now suspected, had been part research mission and part public relations maneuver. A clever get-out-of-jail-free card, he thought. "Historically," Edmond continued, "religious fervor has always suppressed scientific progress, and so tonight I implore religious leaders around the world to react with restraint and understanding to what I am about to say. Please, let us not repeat the bloody violence of history. Let us not make the mistakes of our past." The images on the ceiling dissolved into a drawing of an ancient walled city� a perfectly circular metropolis located on the banks of a river that flowed through a desert. Langdon recognized it at once as ancient Baghdad, its unusual circular construction fortified by three concentric walls topped by merlons and embrasures. "In the eighth century," Edmond said, "the city of Baghdad rose to prominence as the greatest center of learning on earth, welcoming all religions, philosophies, and sciences to its universities and libraries. Lor five hundred years, the outpouring of scientific innovation that flowed from the city was like nothing the world had ever seen, and its influence is still felt today in modern culture." Overhead, the sky of stars reappeared, this time many of the stars bearing names beside them: Vega, Betelgeuse, Rigel, Algebar, Deneb, Acrab, Kitalpha. "Their names are all derived from Arabic," Edmond said. "To this day, more than two-thirds of the stars in the sky have names from that language because they were discovered by astronomers in the Arab world." The sky rapidly filled with so many stars with Arabic names that the heavens were nearly blotted out. The names dissolved again, leaving only the expanse of the heavens. "And, of course, if we want to count the stars ..." Roman numerals began appearing one by one beside the brightest stars. I, II, III, IV, V... The numbers stopped abruptly and disappeared. "We don't use Roman numerals," Edmond said. "We use Arabic numerals." The numbering now began again using the Arabic numbering system. 1, 2, 3, 4,5... ... "You may also recognize these Islamic inventions," Edmond said. "And we all still use their Arabic names." The word algebra floated across the sky, surrounded by a series of multivariable equations. Next came the word algorithm with a diverse array of formulas. Then azimuth with a diagram depicting angles on the earth's horizon. The flow accelerated ... nadir, zenith, alchemy, chemistry, cipher, elixir, ALCOHOL, ALKALINE, ZERO ... As the familiar Arabic words streamed by, Langdon thought how tragic it was that so many Americans pictured Baghdad simply as one of those many dusty, war-torn Middle Eastern cities in the news, never knowing it was once the very heart of human scientific progress. "By the end of the eleventh century," Edmond said, "the greatest intellectual exploration and discovery on earth was taking place in and around Baghdad. Then, almost overnight, that changed. A brilliant scholar named Hamid al- Ghazali�now considered one of the most influential Muslims in history�wrote a series of persuasive texts questioning the logic of Plato and Aristotle and declaring mathematics to be The philosophy of the devil.' This began a confluence of events that undermined scientific thinking. The study of theology was made compulsory, and eventually the entire Islamic scientific movement collapsed." The scientific words overhead evaporated, and were replaced by images of Islamic religious texts. "Revelation replaced investigation. And to this day, the Islamic scientific world is still trying to recover." Edmond paused. "Of course, the Christian scientific world did not fare any better." Paintings of the astronomers Copernicus, Galileo, and Bruno appeared on the ceiling. "The Church's systematic murder, imprisonment, and denunciation of some of history's most brilliant scientific minds delayed human progress by at least a century. Fortunately, today, with our better understanding of the benefits of science, the Church has tempered its attacks ..." Edmond sighed. "Or has it?" A globe logo with a crucifix and serpent appeared with the text: Madrid Declaration on Science & Life "Right here in Spain, the World Federation of the Catholic Medical Associations recently declared war on genetic engineering, proclaiming that 'science lacks soul' and therefore should be restrained by the Church." The globe logo now transformed into a different circle�a schematic blueprint for a massive particle accelerator. "And this was Texas's Superconducting Super Collider�slated to be the largest particle collider in the world�with the potential for exploring the very moment of Creation. This machine was, ironically, positioned in the heart of America's Bible Belt." The image dissolved into a massive ring-shaped cement structure stretching out across the Texas desert. The facility was only half built, covered with dust and dirt, apparently abandoned midway through its construction. "America's super collider could have enormously advanced humankind's understanding of the universe, but the project was canceled due to cost overruns and political pressure from some startling sources." A news clip showed a young televangelist waving the bestselling book The God Particle and angrily shouting, "We should be looking for God inside our hearts! Not inside of atoms! Spending billions on this absurd experiment is an embarrassment to the state of Texas and an affront to God!" Edmond's voice returned. "These conflicts I've described�those in which religious superstition has trumped reason�are merely skirmishes in an ongoing war." The ceiling blazed suddenly with a collage of violent images from modern society�picket lines outside genetic research labs, a priest setting himself on fire outside a Transhumanism conference, evangelicals shaking their fists and holding up the book of Genesis, a Jesus fish eating a Darwin fish, angry religious billboards condemning stem-cell research, gay rights, and abortion, along with equally angry billboards in response. As Langdon lay in the darkness, he could feel his heart pounding. For a moment, he thought the grass beneath him was trembling, as if a subway were approaching. Then, as the vibrations grew stronger, he realized the earth was indeed shaking. Deep, rolling vibrations shuddered up through the grass beneath his back, and the entire dome trembled with a roar. The roar, Langdon now recognized, was the sound of thundering river rapids, being broadcast through subwoofers beneath the turf. He felt a cold, damp mist swirling across his face and body, as if he were lying in the middle of a raging river. "Do you hear that sound?" Edmond called over the booming rapids. "That is the inexorable swelling of the River of Scientific Knowledge!" The water roared even louder now, and the mist felt wet on Langdon's cheeks. "Since man first discovered fire," Edmond shouted, "this river has been gaining power. Every discovery became a tool with which we made new discoveries, each time adding a drop to this river. Today, we ride the crest of a tsunami, a deluge that rages forward with unstoppable force!" The room trembled more violently still. "Where do we come from!" Edmond yelled. "Where are we going! We have always been destined to find the answers! Our methods of inquiry have been evolving exponentially for millennia!" The mist and wind whipped through the room now, and the thundering of the river reached an almost deafening pitch. "Consider this!" Edmond declared. "It took early humans over a million years to progress from discovering fire to inventing the wheel. Then it took only a few thousand years to invent the printing press. Then it took only a couple hundred years to build a telescope. In the centuries that followed, in ever-shortening spans, we bounded from the steam engine, to gas-powered automobiles, to the Space Shuttle! And then, it took only two decades for us to start modifying our own DNA! "We now measure scientific progress in months," Kirsch shouted, "advancing at a mind-boggling pace. It will not take long before today's fastest supercomputer will look like an abacus; today's most advanced surgical methods will seem barbaric; and today's energy sources will seem as quaint to us as using a candle to light a room!" Edmond's voice and the roar of pounding water continued in the thundering darkness. "The early Greeks had to look back centuries to study ancient culture, but we need look back only a single generation to find those who lived without the technologies we take for granted today. The timeline of human development is compressing; the space that separates �ancient' and �modern' is shrinking to nothing at all. And for this reason, I give you my word that the next few years in human development will be shocking, disruptive, and wholly unimaginable! " Without warning, the thundering of the river stopped. The sky of stars returned. So did the warm breeze and the crickets. The guests in the room seemed to exhale in unison. In the abrupt silence, Edmond's voice returned at a whisper. "My friends," he said softly. "I know you are here because I promised you a discovery, and I thank you for indulging me in a bit of preamble. Now let us throw off the shackles of our past thinking. It is time for us to share in the thrill of discovery." With those words, a low creeping fog rolled in from all sides, and the sky overhead began to glow with a predawn light, faintly illuminating the audience below. Suddenly a spotlight blazed to life and swung dramatically to the back of the hall. Within moments, nearly all the guests were sitting up, craning backward through the fog in anticipation of seeing their host appear in the flesh. After a few seconds, however, the spotlight swung back to the front of the room. The audience turned with it. There, at the front of the room, smiling in the blaze of the spotlight, stood Edmond Kirsch. His hands were resting confidently on the sides of a podium that seconds ago had not been there. "Good evening, friends," the great showman said amiably as the fog began to lift. Within seconds, people were on their feet, giving their host a wild standing ovation. Langdon joined them, unable to hold back his smile. Leave it to Edmond to appear in a puff of smoke. So far, tonight's presentation, despite being antagonistic toward religious faith, had been a tour de force�bold and unflinching�like the man himself. Langdon now understood why the world's growing population of freethinkers so idolized Edmond. If nothing else, he speaks his mind in a way few others would dare. When Edmond's face appeared on the screen overhead, Langdon noticed he looked far less pale than before, clearly having been professionally made up. Even so, Langdon could tell his friend was exhausted. The applause continued so loudly that Langdon barely felt the vibration in his breast pocket. Instinctively, he reached in to grab his phone but suddenly realized it was off. Strangely, the vibration was coming from the other device in his pocket�the bone conduction headset�through which Winston now seemed to be talking very loudly. Lousy timing. Langdon fished the transceiver from his jacket pocket and fumbled it into place on his head. The instant the node touched his jawbone, Winston's accented voice materialized in Langdon's head. "�fessor Langdon? Are you there? The phones are disabled. You're my only contact. Professor Langdon?!" "Yes�Winston? I'm here," Langdon replied over the sound of applause around him. "Thank goodness," Winston said. "Listen carefully. We may have a serious problem." CHAPTER 21 as A man who had experienced coundess moments of triumph on the world stage, Edmond Kirsch was eternally motivated by achievement, but he seldom felt total contentment. In this instant, however, standing at the podium receiving a wild ovation, Edmond permitted himself the thrilling joy of knowing he was about to change the world. Sit down, my friends, he willed them. The best is yet to come. As the fog dissipated, Edmond resisted the urge to glance skyward, where he knew a close-up of his own face was being projected across the ceiling and also to millions of people around the world. This is a global moment, he thought proudly. It transcends borders, class, and creeds. Edmond glanced to his left to give a nod of gratitude to Ambra Vidal, who was watching from the corner and had worked tirelessly with him to mount this spectacle. To his surprise, however, Ambra was not looking at him. Instead, she was staring into the crowd, her expression a mask of concern. Something's wrong, Ambra thought, watching from the wings. In the center of the room, a tall, elegantly dressed man was pushing his way through the crowd, waving his arms and heading in Ambra's direction. That's Robert Langdon, she realized, recognizing the American professor from Kirsch's video. Langdon was approaching fast, and both of Ambra's Guardia agents immediately stepped away from the wall, positioning themselves to intercept him. What does he want?! Ambra sensed alarm in Langdon's expression. She spun toward Edmond at the podium, wondering if he had noticed this commotion as well, but Edmond Kirsch was not looking at the audience. Eerily, he was staring directly at her. Edmond! Something's wrong! In that instant, an earsplitting crack echoed inside the dome, and Edmond's head jolted backward. Ambra watched in abject horror as a red crater blossomed in Edmond's forehead. His eyes rolled slightly backward, but his hands held firmly to the podium as his entire body went rigid. He teetered for an instant, his face a mask of confusion, and then, like a falling tree, his body tipped to one side and plummeted toward the floor, his blood-spattered head bouncing hard on the artificial turf as he hit the ground. Before Ambra could even comprehend what she had witnessed, she felt herself being tackled to the ground by one of the Guardia agents. Time stood still. Then ... pandemonium. Illuminated by the glowing projection of Edmond's bloody corpse, a tidal wave of guests stampeded toward the back of the hall trying to escape any more gunfire. As chaos broke out around him, Robert Langdon felt riveted in place, paralyzed by shock. Not far away, his friend lay crumpled on his side, still facing the audience, the bullet hole in his forehead gushing red. Cruelly, Edmond's lifeless face was being illuminated in the stark glare of the spotlight on the television camera, which sat unattended on a tripod, apparently still broadcasting a live feed to the domed ceiling and also to the world. As if moving through a dream, Langdon felt himself running to the TV camera and wrenching it skyward, pivoting the lens away from Edmond. Then he turned and looked through the tangle of fleeing guests toward the podium and his fallen friend, knowing for certain that Edmond was gone. My God ... / tried to alert you, Edmond, but Winston's warning came too late. Not far from Edmond's body, on the floor, Langdon saw a Guardia agent crouched protectively over Ambra Vidal. Langdon hurried directly toward her, but the agent reacted on instinct�launching himself upward and outward, taking three long strides and driving his body into Langdon's. The guard's shoulder crashed squarely into Langdon's sternum, expelling every bit of air in Langdon's lungs and sending a shock wave of pain through his body as he sailed backward through the air, landing hard on the artificial turf. Before he could even take a breath, powerful hands flipped him onto his stomach, twisted his left arm behind his back, and pressed an iron palm onto the back of his head, leaving Langdon totally immobilized with his left cheek squashed into the turf. "You knew about this before it happened," the guard shouted. "How are you involved!" Twenty yards away, Guardia Real agent Rafa Diaz scrambled through throngs of fleeing guests and tried to reach the spot on the sidewall where he had seen the flash of a gunshot. Ambra Vidal is safe, he assured himself, having seen his partner pull her to the floor and cover her body with his own. In addition, Diaz felt certain there was nothing to be done for the victim. Edmond Kirsch was dead before he hit the ground. Eerily, Diaz noted, one of the guests appeared to have had advance warning of the attack, rushing the podium only an instant before the gunshot. Whatever the reason, Diaz knew it could wait. At the moment, he had only one task. Apprehend the shooter. As Diaz arrived at the site of the telltale flash, he found a slit in the fabric wall and plunged his hand through the opening, violently tearing the hole all the way down to the floor and clambering out of the dome into a maze of scaffolding. To his left, the agent caught a glimpse of a figure�a tall man dressed in a white military uniform�sprinting toward the emergency exit at the far side of the enormous space. An instant later, the fleeing figure crashed through the door and disappeared. Diaz gave pursuit, weaving through the electronics outside the dome and finally bursting through the door into a cement stairwell. He peered over the railing and saw the fugitive two floors below, spiraling downward at breakneck speed. Diaz raced after him, leaping five stairs at a time. Somewhere below, the exit door crashed open loudly and then slammed shut again. He's exited the building! When Diaz reached the ground floor, he sprinted to the exit�a pair of double doors with horizontal push bars�and threw all of his weight into them. The doors, rather than flying open like those upstairs, moved only an inch and then jammed to a stop. Diaz's body crashed into the wall of steel, and he landed in a heap, a searing pain erupting in his shoulder. Shaken, he pulled himself up and tried the doors again. They opened just far enough to allow him to glimpse the problem. Strangely, the outer door handles had been bound shut by a loop of wire�a string of beads wrapped around the handles from the outside. Diaz's confusion deepened when he realized the pattern of the beads was quite familiar to him, as it would be to any good Spanish Catholic. Is that a rosary? Using all of his force, Diaz heaved his aching body into the doors again, but the string of beads refused to break. He stared again through the narrow opening, baffled both by the presence of a rosary and also by his inability to break it. "lHola ?" he shouted through the doors. "j^Hay alguien?!" Silence. Through the slit in the doors, Diaz could make out a high concrete wall and a deserted service alley. Chances were slim that anyone would be coming by to remove the loop. Seeing no other option, he grabbed his handgun from the holster beneath his blazer. He cocked the weapon and extended the barrel through the doorway slit. He pressed the muzzle into the string of rosary beads. I'm firing a bullet into a holy rosary? Que Dios me perdone. The remaining pieces of the crucifix bobbed up and down before Diaz's eyes. He pulled the trigger. The gunshot thundered in the cement landing, and the doors flew open. The rosary shattered, and Diaz lurched forward, staggering out into the empty alley as rosary beads bounced across the pavement all around him. The assassin in white was gone. A hundred meters away, Admiral Luis Avila sat in silence in the backseat of the black Renault that now accelerated away from the museum. The tensile strength of the Vectran fiber on which Avila had strung the rosary beads had done its job, delaying his pursuers just long enough. And now I am gone. As Avila's car sped northwest along the meandering Nervion River and disappeared among the fast-moving cars on the Avenida Abandoibarra, Admiral Avila finally permitted himself to exhale. His mission tonight could not have gone any more smoothly. In his mind, he began to hear the joyful strains of the Oriamendi hymn�its age-old lyrics once sung in bloody battle right here in Bilbao. ;Por Dios, por la Patria y el Rey! Avila sang in his mind. For God, for Country, and King! The battle cry had long since been forgotten ... but the war had just begun. CHAPTER 22 Madrid's palacio real is Europe's largest royal palace as well as one of its most stunning architectural fusions of Classical and Baroque styles. Built on the site of a ninth-century Moorish castle, the palace's three-story facade of columns spans the entire five-hundred-foot width of the sprawling Plaza de la Armeria on which it sits. The interior is a mind-boggling labyrinth of 3,418 rooms that wind through almost a million and a half square feet of floor space. The salons, bedrooms, and hallways are adorned with a collection of priceless religious art, including masterpieces by Velazquez, Goya, and Rubens. For generations, the palace had been the private residence of Spanish kings and queens. Now, however, it was used primarily for state functions, with the royal family taking residence in the more casual and secluded Palacio de la Zarzuela outside the city. In recent months, however, Madrid's formal palace had become the permanent home for Crown Prince Julian�the forty-two-year-old future king of Spain� who had moved into the palace at the behest of his handlers, who wanted Julian to "be more visible to the country" during this somber period prior to his eventual coronation. Prince Julian's father, the current king, had been bedridden for months with a terminal illness. As the fading king's mental faculties eroded, the palace had begun the slow transfer of power, preparing the prince to ascend to the throne once his father passed. With a shift in leadership now imminent, Spaniards had turned their eyes to Crown Prince Julian, with a single question on their minds: What kind of ruler will he turn out to be? Prince Julian had always been a discreet and cautious child, having borne the weight of his eventual sovereignty since boyhood. Julian's mother had died from preterm complications while carrying her second child, and the king, to the surprise of many, had chosen never to remarry, leaving Julian the lone successor to the Spanish throne. An heir with no spare, the UK tabloids coldly called the prince. Because Julian had matured under the wing of his deeply conservative father, most traditionalist Spaniards believed he would continue their kings' austere tradition of preserving the dignity of the Spanish crown through maintaining established conventions, celebrating ritual, and above all, remaining ever reverential to Spain's rich Catholic history. For centuries, the legacy of the Catholic kings had served as Spain's moral center. In recent years, though, the country's bedrock of faith seemed to be dissolving, and Spain found herself locked in a violent tug-of-war between the very old and the very new. A growing number of liberals were now flooding blogs and social media with rumors suggesting that once Julian was finally able to emerge from his father's shadow, he would reveal his true self�a bold, progressive, secular leader finally willing to follow the lead of so many European countries and abolish the monarchy entirely. Julian's father had always been very active in his role as king, leaving Julian little room to participate in politics. The king openly stated that he believed Julian should enjoy his youth, and not until the prince was married and settled down did it make sense for him to engage in matters of state. And so Julian's first forty years�endlessly chronicled in the Spanish press�had been a life of private schools, horseback riding, ribbon cuttings, fund-raisers, and world travel. Despite having accomplished little of note in his life, Prince Julian was, without a doubt, Spain's most eligible bachelor. Over the years, the handsome forty-two-year-old prince had publicly dated countless eligible women, and while he had a reputation for being a hopeless romantic, nobody had ever quite stolen his heart. In recent months, however, Julian had been spotted several times with a beautiful woman who, despite looking like a retired fashion model, was in fact the highly respected director of Bilbao's Guggenheim Museum. The media immediately hailed Ambra Vidal as "a perfect match for a modern king." She was cultured, successful, and most importantly, not a scion of one of Spain's noble families. Ambra Vidal was of the people. The prince apparently agreed with their assessment, and after only a very short courtship, Julian proposed to her�in a most unexpected and romantic way �and Ambra Vidal accepted. In the weeks that followed, the press reported daily on Ambra Vidal, noting that she was turning out to be much more than a pretty face. She quickly revealed herself as a fiercely independent woman who, despite being the future queen consort of Spain, flatly refused to permit the Guardia Real to interfere with her daily schedule or let their agents provide her with protection at anything other than a major public event. When the commander of the Guardia Real discreetly suggested Ambra start wearing clothing that was more conservative and less formfitting, Ambra made a public joke out of it, saying she had been reprimanded by the commander of the "Guardarropia Real"�the Royal Wardrobe. The liberal magazines splashed her face all over their covers. "Ambra! Spain's Beautiful Future!" When she refused an interview, they hailed her as "independent"; when she granted an interview, they hailed her as "accessible." Conservative magazines countered by deriding the brash new queen-to-be as a power-hungry opportunist who would be a dangerous influence on the future king. As evidence, they cited her blatant disregard for the prince's reputation. Their initial concern centered on Ambra's habit of addressing Prince Julian by his first name alone, eschewing the traditional custom of referring to him as Don Julian or su alteza. Their second concern, however, seemed far more serious. For the past several weeks, Ambra's work schedule had made her almost entirely unavailable to the prince, and yet she had been sighted repeatedly in Bilbao, having lunch near the museum with an outspoken atheist�American technologist Edmond Kirsch. Despite Ambra's insistence that the lunches were simply planning meetings with one of the museum's major donors, sources inside the palace suggested that Julian's blood was beginning to boil. Not that anyone could blame him. The truth of the matter was that Julian's stunning fiancee�only weeks after their engagement�had been choosing to spend most of her time with another man. CHAPTER 23 langdon'S face remained pressed hard into the turf. The weight of the agent on top of him was crushing. Strangely, he felt nothing. Langdon's emotions were scattered and numb�twisting layers of sadness, fear, and outrage. One of the world's most brilliant minds�a dear friend�had just been publicly executed in the most brutal manner. He was killed only moments before he revealed the greatest discovery of his life. Langdon now realized that the tragic loss of human life was accompanied by a second loss�a scientific one. Now the world may never know what Edmond found. Langdon flushed with sudden anger, followed by steely determination. I will do everything possible to find out who is responsible for this. I will honor your legacy, Edmond. I will find a way to share your discovery with the world. "You knew," the guard's voice rasped, close in his ear. "You were heading for the podium like you expected something to happen." "I ... was ... warned," Langdon managed, barely able to breathe. "Warned by whom ?! " Langdon could feel his transducer headset twisted and askew on his cheek. "The headset on my face ... it's an automated docent. Edmond Kirsch's computer warned me. It found an anomaly on the guest list�a retired admiral from the Spanish navy." The guard's head was now close enough to Langdon's ear that he could hear the man's radio earpiece crackle to life. The voice in the transmission was breathless and urgent, and although Langdon's Spanish was spotty, he heard enough to decipher the bad news. ...el asesino ha huido ... The assassin had escaped. ... salida bloqueada ... An exit had been blocked. ... uniforme militar bianco ... As the words "military uniform" were spoken, the guard on top of Langdon eased off the pressure. "<?Uniforme naval?" he asked his partner. "Blanco ... ^Como de almirante?" The response was affirmative. A naval uniform, Langdon realized. Winston was right. The guard released Langdon and got off him. "Roll over." Langdon twisted painfully onto his back and propped himself up on his elbows. His head was spinning and his chest felt bruised. "Don't move," the guard said. Langdon had no intention of moving; the officer standing over him was about two hundred pounds of solid muscle and had already shown he was dead serious about his job. "jlnmediatamente!" the guard barked into his radio, continuing with an urgent request for support from local authorities and roadblocks around the museum. ... policia local ... bloqueos de carretera ... From his position on the floor, Langdon could see Ambra Vidal, still on the ground near the sidewall. She tried to stand up, but faltered, collapsing on her hands and knees. Somebody help her! But the guard was now shouting across the dome, seeming to address nobody in particular. "; Luces! \ Ycobertura de movil!" I need lights and phone service! Langdon reached up and straightened the transducer headset on his face. "Winston, are you there?" The guard turned, eyeing Langdon strangely. "I am here." Winston's voice was flat. "Winston, Edmond was shot. We need the lights back on right away. We need cellular service restored. Can you control that? Or contact someone who can?" Seconds later, the lights in the dome rose abruptly, dissolving the magical illusion of a moonlit meadow and illuminating a deserted expanse of artificial turf scattered with abandoned blankets. The guard seemed startled by Langdon's apparent power. After a moment, he reached down and pulled Langdon to his feet. The two men faced each other in the stark light. The agent was tall, the same height as Langdon, with a shaved head and a muscular body that strained at his blue blazer. His face was pale with muted features that set off his sharp eyes, which, at the moment, were focused like lasers on Langdon. "You were in the video tonight. You're Robert Langdon." "Yes. Edmond Kirsch was my student and friend." "I am Agent Fonseca with the Guardia Real," he announced in perfect English. "Tell me how you knew about the navy uniform." Langdon turned toward Edmond's body, which lay motionless on the grass beside the podium. Ambra Vidal knelt beside the body along with two museum security guards and a staff paramedic, who had already abandoned efforts to revive him. Ambra gently covered the corpse with a blanket. Clearly, Edmond was gone. Langdon felt nauseated, unable to pull his eyes from his murdered friend. "We can't help him," the guard snapped. "Tell me how you knew." Langdon returned his eyes to the guard, whose tone left no room for misinterpretation. It was an order. Langdon quickly relayed what Winston had told him�that the docent program had flagged one of the guest's headsets as having been abandoned, and when a human docent found the headset in a trash receptacle, they checked which guest had been assigned that headset, alarmed to find that he was a last- minute write-in on the guest list. "Impossible." The guard's eyes narrowed. "The guest list was locked yesterday. Everyone underwent a background check." "Not this man," Winston's voice announced in Langdon's headset. "I was concerned and ran the guest's name, only to find he was a former Spanish navy admiral, discharged for alcoholism and post-traumatic stress suffered in a terrorist attack in Seville five years ago." Langdon relayed the information to the guard. "The bombing of the cathedral?" The guard looked incredulous. "Lurthermore," Winston told Langdon, "I found the officer had no connection whatsoever to Mr. Kirsch, which concerned me, and so I contacted museum security to set off alarms, but without more conclusive information, they argued we should not ruin Edmond's event�especially while it was being live-streamed to the world. Knowing how hard Edmond worked on tonight's program, their logic made sense to me, and so I immediately contacted you, Robert, in hopes you could spot this man so I could discreetly guide a security team to him. I should have taken stronger action. I failed Edmond." Langdon found it somewhat unnerving that Edmond's machine seemed to experience guilt. He glanced back toward Edmond's covered body and saw Ambra Vidal approaching. Fonseca ignored her, still focused directly on Langdon. "The computer," he asked, "did it give you a name for the naval officer in question?" Langdon nodded. "His name is Admiral Luis Avila." As he spoke the name, Ambra stopped short and stared at Langdon, a look of utter horror on her face. Fonseca noted her reaction and immediately moved toward her. "Ms. Vidal? You're familiar with the name?" Ambra seemed unable to reply. She lowered her gaze and stared at the floor as if she had just seen a ghost. "Ms. Vidal," Fonseca repeated. "Admiral Luis Avila�do you know this name?" Ambra's shell-shocked expression left little doubt that she did indeed know the killer. After a stunned moment, she blinked twice and her dark eyes began to clear, as if she were emerging from a trance. "No ... I don't know the name," she whispered, glancing at Langdon and then back at her security guard. "I was just ... shocked to hear that the killer was an officer of the Spanish navy." She's lying, Langdon sensed, puzzled as to why she would attempt to disguise her reaction. I saw it. She recognized that man's name. "Who was in charge of the guest list?!" Fonseca demanded, taking another step toward Ambra. "Who added this man's name?" Ambra's lips were trembling now. "I ... I have no idea." The guard's questions were interrupted by a sudden cacophony of cell phones ringing and beeping throughout the dome. Winston had apparently found a way to restore cell service, and one of the phones now ringing was in Fonseca's blazer pocket. The Guardia agent reached for his phone and, seeing the caller ID, took a deep breath and answered. "Ambra Vidal esta a salvo," he announced. Ambra Vidal is safe. Langdon moved his gaze to the distraught woman. She was already looking at him. When their eyes met, they held each other's stare for a long moment. Then Langdon heard Winston's voice materialize in his headset. "Professor," Winston whispered. "Ambra Vidal knows very well how Luis Avila got onto the guest list. She added his name herself." Langdon needed a moment to make sense of the information. Ambra Vidal herself placed the killer on the guest list? And now she's lying about it?! Before Langdon could fully process this information, Fonseca was handing his cell phone to Ambra. The agent said, "Don Julian quiere hablar con usted." Ambra seemed almost to recoil from the phone. "Tell him I'm fine," she replied. "I'll call him in a little while." The guard's expression was one of utter disbelief. He covered the phone and whispered to Ambra, "Su alteza Don Julian, el prmcipe, ha pedido �" "I don't care if he's the prince," she fired back. "If he's going to be my husband, he will have to learn to give me space when I need it. I just witnessed a murder, and I need a minute to myself! Tell him I'll call him shortly." Fonseca stared at the woman, his eyes flashing an emotion that bordered on contempt. Then he turned and walked off to continue his call in private. For Langdon, the bizarre exchange had solved one small mystery. Ambra Vidal is engaged to Prince Julian of Spain ? This news explained the celebrity treatment she was receiving and also the presence of the Guardia Real, although it certainly did not explain her refusal to accept her fiance's call. The prince must be worried to death if he saw this on television. Almost instantly, Langdon was struck by a second, far darker revelation. Oh my God ... Ambra Vidal is connected to Madrid's Royal Palace. The unexpected coincidence sent a chill through him as he recalled Edmond's threatening voice mail from Bishop Valdespino. CHAPTER 24 two hundred yards from Madrid's Royal Palace, inside Almudena Cathedral, Bishop Valdespino had momentarily stopped breathing. He still wore his ceremonial robes and was seated at his office laptop, riveted by the images being transmitted from Bilbao. This will be a massive news story. From all he could see, the global media were already going wild. The top news outlets were lining up authorities on science and religion to speculate about Kirsch's presentation, while everyone else offered hypotheses as to who murdered Edmond Kirsch and why. The media seemed to concur that, by all appearances, someone out there was deadly serious about making sure Kirsch's discovery never saw the light of day. After a long moment of reflection, Valdespino took out his cell phone and placed a call. Rabbi Koves answered on the first ring. "Terrible!" The rabbi's voice was nearly a shriek. "I was watching on television! We need to go to the authorities right now and tell them what we know!" "Rabbi," Valdespino replied, his tone measured. "I agree this is a horrifying turn of events. But before we take action, we need to think." "There is nothing to think about!" Koves fired back. "Clearly, someone will stop at nothing to bury Kirsch's discovery, and they are butchers! I am convinced they also killed Syed. They must know who we are and will be coming for us next. You and I have a moral obligation to go to the authorities and tell them what Kirsch told us." "A moral obligation?" Valdespino challenged. "It sounds more like you want to make the information public so nobody has a motive to silence you and me personally." "Certainly, our safety is a consideration," the rabbi argued, "but we also have a moral obligation to the world. I realize this discovery will call into question some fundamental religious beliefs, but if there is one thing I have learned in my long life, it is that faith always survives, even in the face of great hardship. I believe faith will survive this too, even if we reveal Kirsch's findings." "I hear you, my friend," the bishop finally said, maintaining as even a tone as possible. "I can hear the resolution in your voice, and I respect your thinking. I want you to know that I am open to discussion, and even to being swayed in my thinking. And yet, I beseech you, if we are going to unveil this discovery to the world, let us do it together. In the light of day. With honor. Not in desperation on the heels of this horrific assassination. Let us plan it, rehearse it, and frame the news properly." Koves said nothing, but Valdespino could hear the old man breathing. "Rabbi," the bishop continued, "at the moment, the single most pressing issue is our personal safety. We are dealing with killers, and if you make yourself too visible�for example, by going to the authorities or to a television station�it could end violently. I'm fearful for you in particular; I have protection here inside the palace complex, but you ... you are alone in Budapest! Clearly, Kirsch's discovery is a life-and-death matter. Please let me arrange for your protection, Yehuda." Koves fell silent a moment. "From Madrid ? How can you possibly�" "I have the security resources of the royal family at my disposal. Remain inside your home with your doors locked. I will request that two Guardia Real agents collect you and bring you to Madrid, where we can make sure you are safe in the palace complex and where you and I can sit down face-to-face and discuss how best to move forward." "If I come to Madrid," the rabbi said tentatively, "what if you and I cannot agree on how to proceed?" "We will agree," the bishop assured him. "I know I am old-fashioned, but I am also a realist, like yourself. Together we will find the best course of action. I have faith in that." "And if your faith is misplaced?" Koves pressed. Valdespino felt his stomach tighten, but he paused a moment, exhaled, and replied as calmly as he could. "Yehuda, if, in the end, you and I cannot find a way to proceed together, then we will part as friends, and we will each do what we feel is best. You have my word on that." "Thank you," Koves replied. "On your word, I will come to Madrid." "Good. In the meantime, lock your doors and speak to no one. Pack a bag, and I'll call you with details when I have them." Valdespino paused. "And have faith. I'll see you very soon." Valdespino hung up, a feeling of dread in his heart; he suspected that continuing to control Koves would require more than a plea for rationality and pmdence. Koves is panicking ... just like Syed. Both of them fail to see the bigger picture. Valdespino closed his laptop, tucked it under his arm, and made his way through the darkened sanctuary. Still wearing his ceremonial robes, he exited the cathedral into the cool night air and headed across the plaza toward the gleaming white facade of the Royal Palace. Above the main entrance, Valdespino could see the Spanish coat of arms�a crest flanked by the Pillars of Hercules and the ancient motto plus ultra, meaning "further beyond." Some believed the phrase referred to Spain's centuries-long quest to expand the empire during its golden age. Others believed it reflected the country's long-held belief that a life in heaven existed beyond this one. Either way, Valdespino sensed the motto was less relevant every day. As he eyed the Spanish flag flying high above the palace, he sighed sadly, his thoughts turning back to his ailing king. I will miss him when he's gone. I owe him so much. For months now, the bishop had made daily visits to his beloved friend, who was bedridden in Palacio de la Zarzuela on the outskirts of the city. A few days ago, the king had summoned Valdespino to his bedside, a look of deep concern in his eyes. "Antonio," the king had whispered, "I fear my son's engagement was ... rushed." Insane is a more accurate description, Valdespino thought. Two months earlier, when the prince had confided in Valdespino that he intended to propose marriage to Ambra Vidal after knowing her only a very short time, the stupefied bishop had begged Julian to be more prudent. The prince had argued that he was in love and that his father deserved to see his only son married. Moreover, he said, if he and Ambra were to have a family, her age would require that they not wait too long. Valdespino calmly smiled down at the king. "Yes, I agree. Don Julian's proposal took us all by surprise. But he only wanted to make you happy." "His duty is to his country," the king said forcefully, "not to his father. And while Ms. Vidal is lovely, she is an unknown to us, an outsider. I question her motives in accepting Don Julian's proposal. It was far too hasty, and a woman of honor would have rejected him." "You are correct," Valdespino replied, although in Ambra's defense, Don Julian had given her little choice. The king gently reached out and took the bishop's bony hand in his own. "My friend, I don't know where the time has gone. You and I have grown old. I want to thank you. You have counseled me wisely through the years, through the loss of my wife, through the changes in our country, and I have benefited greatly from the strength of your conviction." "Our friendship is an honor I will treasure forever." The king smiled weakly. "Antonio, I know you have made sacrifices in order to stay with me. Rome, for one." Valdespino shrugged. "Becoming a cardinal would have brought me no closer to God. My place has always been here with you." "Your loyalty has been a blessing." "And I will never forget the compassion you showed me all those years ago." The king closed his eyes, gripping the bishop's hand tightly. "Antonio ... Iam concerned. My son will soon find himself at the helm of a massive ship, a ship he is not prepared to navigate. Please guide him. Be his polestar. Place your steady hand atop his on the rudder, especially in rough seas. Above all, when he goes off course, I beg you to help him find his way back ... back to all that is pure." "Amen," the bishop whispered. "I give you my word." Now, in the cool night air, as Valdespino made his way across the plaza, he raised his eyes to the heavens. Your Majesty, please know that I am doing all I can to honor your final wishes. Valdespino took solace in knowing that the king was far too weak now to watch television. If he had seen tonight's broadcast out of Bilbao, he would have died on the spot to witness what his beloved country had come to. To Valdespino's right, beyond the iron gates, all along Calle de Bailen, media trucks had gathered and were extending their satellite towers. Vultures, Valdespino thought, the evening air whipping at his robes. CHAPTER 25 there will be time to mourn, Langdon told himself, fighting back intense emotion. Now is the time for action. Langdon had already asked Winston to search museum security feeds for any information that might be helpful in apprehending the shooter. Then he had quietly added that Winston should search for any connections between Bishop Valdespino and Avila. Agent Fonseca was returning now, still on the phone. "Si ... si," he was saying. "Claro. Inmediatemente." Fonseca ended the call and turned his attention to Ambra, who stood nearby, looking dazed. "Ms. Vidal, we're leaving," Fonseca announced, his tone sharp. "Don Julian has demanded that we get you to safety inside the Royal Palace at once." Ambra's body tensed visibly. "I'm not abandoning Edmond like that!" She motioned to the crumpled corpse beneath the blanket. "Local authorities will be taking over this matter," Fonseca replied. "And the coroner is on his way. Mr. Kirsch will be handled respectfully and with great care. At the moment, we need to leave. We're afraid you're in danger." "I am most certainly not in danger!" Ambra declared, stepping toward him. "An assassin just had the perfect opportunity to shoot me and did not. Clearly, he was after Edmond!" "Ms. Vidal!" The veins in Fonseca's neck twitched. "The prince wants you in Madrid. He is worried about your safety." "No," she fired back. "He's worried about the political fallout." Fonseca exhaled a long, slow breath and lowered his voice. "Ms. Vidal, what happened tonight has been a terrible blow for Spain. It has also been a terrible blow for the prince. Your hosting tonight's event was an unfortunate decision." Winston's voice spoke suddenly inside Langdon's head. "Professor? The museum's security team has been analyzing the building's external camera feeds. It appears they've found something." Langdon listened and then waved a hand at Fonseca, interrupting the agent's reprimand of Ambra. "Sir, the computer said one of the museum's rooftop cameras got a partial photo of the top of the getaway car." "Oh?" Fonseca looked surprised. Langdon relayed the information as Winston gave it to him. "A black sedan leaving the service alley ... license plates not legible from that high angle ... an unusual sticker on the windshield." "What sticker?" Fonseca demanded. "We can alert local authorities to look for it." "The sticker," Winston replied in Langdon's head, "is not one I recognized, but I compared its shape to all known symbols in the world, and I received a single match." Langdon was amazed how fast Winston had been able to make all this happen. "The match I received," Winston said, "was for an ancient alchemical symbol � amalgamation." I beg your pardon ? Langdon had expected the logo of a parking garage or a political organization. "The car sticker shows the symbol for ... amalgamation?" Fonseca looked on, clearly lost. "There must be some mistake, Winston," Langdon said. "Why would anyone display the symbol for an alchemical process?" "I don't know," Winston replied. "This is the only match I got, and I'm showing ninety-nine percent correspondence." Langdon's eidetic memory quickly conjured the alchemical symbol for amalgamation. "Winston, describe exactly what you see in the car window." The computer replied immediately. "The symbol consists of one vertical line crossed by three transverse lines. On top of the vertical line sits an upward- facing arch." Precisely. Langdon frowned. "The arch on top�does it have capstones?" "Yes. A short horizontal line sits on top of each arm." Okay then, it's amalgamation. Langdon puzzled for a moment. "Winston, can you send us the photo from the security feed?" "Of course." "Send it to my phone," Fonseca demanded. Langdon relayed the agent's cell-phone number to Winston, and a moment later, Fonseca's device pinged. They all gathered around the agent and looked at the grainy black-and-white photo. It was an overhead shot of a black sedan in a deserted service alley. Sure enough, in the lower-left-hand corner of the windshield, Langdon could see a sticker displaying the exact symbol Winston had described. Amalgamation. How bizarre. Puzzled, Langdon reached over and used his fingertips to enlarge the photo on Fonseca's screen. Leaning in, he studied the more detailed image. Immediately Langdon saw the problem. "It's not amalgamation," he announced. Although the image was very close to what Winston had described, it was not exact. And in symbology, the difference between "close" and "exact" could be the difference between a Nazi swastika and a Buddhist symbol of prosperity. This is why the human mind is sometimes better than a computer. "It's not one sticker," Langdon declared. "It's two different stickers overlapping a bit. The sticker on the bottom is a special crucifix called the papal cross. It's very popular right now." With the election of the most liberal pontiff in Vatican history, thousands of people around the globe were showing their support for the pope's new policies by displaying the triple cross, even in Langdon's hometown of Cambridge, Massachusetts. "The U-shaped symbol on top," Langdon said, "is a separate sticker entirely." "I now see you are correct," Winston said. �Til find the phone number for the company." Again Langdon was amazed by Winston's speed. He's already identified the company logo? "Excellent," Langdon said. "If we call them, they can track the car." Fonseca looked bewildered. "Track the car! How?" "This getaway car was hired," Langdon said, pointing to the stylized U on the windshield. "It's an Uber." CHAPTER 26 from the look of wide-eyed disbelief on Fonseca's face, Langdon couldn't tell what surprised the agent more: the quick decryption of the windshield sticker, or Admiral Avila's odd choice of getaway car. He hired an Uber, Langdon thought, wondering if the move was brilliant or incredibly shortsighted. Uber's ubiquitous "on-demand driver" service had taken the world by storm over the past few years. Via smartphone, anyone requiring a ride could instantly connect with a growing army of Uber drivers who made extra money by hiring out their own cars as improvised taxis. Only recently legalized in Spain, Uber required its Spanish drivers to display Uber's U logo on their windshields. Apparently, the driver of this Uber getaway car was also a fan of the new pope. "Agent Fonseca," Langdon said. "Winston says he has taken the liberty of sending the image of the getaway car to local authorities to distribute at roadblocks." Fonseca's mouth fell open, and Langdon sensed that this highly trained agent was not accustomed to playing catch-up. Fonseca seemed uncertain whether to thank Winston or tell him to mind his own damn business. "And he is now dialing Uber's emergency number." "No!" Fonseca commanded. "Give me the number. I'll call myself. Uber will be more likely to assist a senior member of the Royal Guard than they will a computer." Langdon had to admit Fonseca was probably right. Besides, it seemed far better that the Guardia assist in the manhunt than waste their skills transporting Ambra to Madrid. After getting the number from Winston, Fonseca dialed, and Langdon felt rising confidence that they might catch the assassin in a matter of minutes. Locating vehicles was at the heart of Uber's business; any customer with a smartphone could literally access the precise locations of every Uber driver on earth. All Fonseca would need to do was ask the company to locate the driver who had just picked up a passenger behind the Guggenheim Museum. "jHostia!" Fonseca cursed. " Automatizada ." He stabbed at a number on his keypad and waited, apparently having reached an automated list of menu options. "Professor, once I get through to Uber and order a trace on the car, I will be handing this matter over to local authorities so Agent Diaz and I can transport you and Ms. Vidal to Madrid." "Me?" Langdon replied, startled. "No, I can't possibly join you." "You can and you will," Fonseca declared. "As will your computer toy," he added, pointing to Langdon's headset. "I'm sorry," Langdon responded, his tone hardening. "There is no way I can accompany you to Madrid." "That's odd," Fonseca replied. "I thought you were a Harvard professor?" Langdon gave him a puzzled look. "I am." "Good," Fonseca snapped. "Then I assume you're smart enough to realize you have no choice." With that, the agent stalked off, returning to his phone call. Langdon watched him go. What the hell? "Professor?" Ambra had stepped very close to Langdon and whispered behind him. "I need you to listen to me. It's very important." Langdon turned, startled to see that Ambra's expression was one of profound fear. Her mute shock seemed to have passed, and her tone was desperate and clear. "Professor," she said, "Edmond showed you enormous respect by featuring you in his presentation. For this reason, I'm going to trust you. I need to tell you something." Langdon eyed her, uncertain. "Edmond's murder was my fault," she whispered, her deep brown eyes welling with tears. "I beg your pardon?" Ambra glanced nervously at Fonseca, who was now out of earshot. "The guest list," she said, returning to Langdon. "The last-minute addition. The name that was added?" "Yes, Luis Avila." "I am the person who added that name," she confessed, her voice cracking. "It was me!" Winston was correct ..., Langdon thought, stunned. "I'm the reason Edmond was murdered," she said, now on the verge of tears. "I let his killer inside this building." "Hold on," Langdon said, placing a hand on her trembling shoulder. "Just talk to me. Why did you add his name?" Ambra shot another anxious glance at Fonseca, who was still on the phone twenty yards away. "Professor, I received a last-minute request from someone I trust deeply. He asked me to add Admiral Avila's name to the guest list as a personal favor. The request came only minutes before the doors opened, and I was busy, so I added the name without thinking. I mean, he was an admiral in the navy! How could I possibly have known?" She looked again at Edmond's body and covered her mouth with a slender hand. "And now ..." "Ambra," Langdon whispered. "Who was it that asked you to add Avila's name?" Ambra swallowed hard. "It was my fiance ... the crown prince of Spain. Don Julian." Langdon stared at her in disbelief, trying to process her words. The director of the Guggenheim had just claimed that the crown prince of Spain had helped orchestrate the assassination of Edmond Kirsch. That's impossible. "I'm sure the palace never expected I would learn the killer's identity," she said. "But now that I know ... I fear I'm in danger." Langdon put a hand on her shoulder. "You're perfectly safe here." "No," she whispered forcefully, "there are things going on here that you don't understand. You and I need to get out. Now!" "We can't run," Langdon countered. "We'll never�" "Please listen to me," she urged. "I know how to help Edmond." "I'm sorry?" Langdon sensed that she was still in shock. "Edmond can't be helped." "Yes, he can," she insisted, her tone lucid. "But first, we'll need to get inside his home in Barcelona." "What are you talking about?" "Please just listen to me carefully. I know what Edmond would want us to do." For the next fifteen seconds, Ambra Vidal spoke to Langdon in hushed tones. As she talked, Langdon felt his heart rate climbing. My God, he thought. She's right. This changes everything. When she was finished, Ambra looked up at him defiantly. "Now do you see why we need to go?" Langdon nodded without hesitation. "Winston," he said into his headset. "Did you hear what Ambra just told me?" "I did, Professor." "Were you already aware of this?" "No." Langdon considered his next words very carefully. "Winston, I don't know if computers can feel loyalty to their creators, but if you can, this is your moment of truth. We could really use your help." CHAPTER 27 as langdon moved toward the podium, he kept one eye on Fonseca, who was still engrossed in his phone call to Uber. He watched as Ambra drifted casually toward the center of the dome, talking on her phone too�or at least pretending to talk�precisely as Langdon had suggested. Tell Fonseca you decided to call Prince Julian. As Langdon reached the podium, he reluctantly turned his gaze to the crumpled form on the floor. Edmond. Gently, Langdon pulled back the blanket that Ambra had placed over him. Edmond's once bright eyes were now two lifeless slits below a crimson hole in his forehead. Langdon shuddered at the gruesome image, his heart pounding with loss and rage. For an instant, Langdon could still see the young mop-haired student who had entered his class full of hope and talent�and had gone on to accomplish so much in so brief a time. Horrifically, tonight, someone had murdered this astonishingly gifted human being, almost certainly in an attempt to bury his discovery forever. And unless I take bold action, Langdon knew, my student's greatest accomplishment will never see the light of day. Positioning himself so that the podium was partially blocking Fonseca's line of sight, Langdon knelt down beside Edmond's body, closed his eyes, folded his hands together, and assumed the reverent posture of prayer. The irony of praying over an atheist almost caused Langdon to smile. Edmond, I know that you of all people don't want anyone praying for you. Don't worry, my friend, Em not actually here to pray. As he knelt over Edmond, Langdon fought a rising fear. I assured you the bishop was harmless. If Valdespino turns out to be involved in this ... Langdon pushed it from his mind. Once he felt certain that Fonseca had spotted him praying, Langdon very discreetly leaned forward and reached inside Edmond's leather jacket, removing his oversized turquoise phone. He glanced quickly back toward Fonseca, who was still on the phone and now seemed less interested in Langdon than he did in Ambra, who appeared to be engrossed in her own phone call and was wandering farther and farther away from Fonseca. Langdon returned his eyes to Edmond's phone and took a calming breath. One more thing to do. Gently, he reached down and lifted Edmond's right hand. It already felt cold. Bringing the phone to his fingertips, Langdon carefully pressed Edmond's index finger to the fingerprint recognition disk. The phone clicked and unlocked. Langdon quickly scrolled to the settings menu and disabled the password protection feature. Permanently unlocked. Then he slipped the phone into his jacket pocket and covered Edmond's body again with the blanket. Sirens wailed in the distance as Ambra stood alone in the center of the deserted auditorium and held her cell phone to her ear, pretending to be absorbed in a conversation, all the while very aware of Fonseca's eyes on her. Hurry, Robert. A minute ago, the American professor had leaped into action after Ambra had shared with him a recent conversation she'd had with Edmond Kirsch. Ambra told Langdon that two nights ago, in this very room, she and Edmond had been working late on the final details of the presentation when Edmond had taken a break to have his third spinach smoothie of the night. Ambra had noticed how exhausted he looked. "I've got to say, Edmond," she had said, "I'm not sure this vegan diet is working for you. You're looking pale, and much too thin." "Too thin?" He laughed. "Look who's talking." "I'm not too thin!" "Borderline." He winked playfully at her indignant expression. "As for my being pale, give me a break. I'm a computer geek who sits all day in the glow of an LCD screen." "Well, you're addressing the entire world in two days, and a little color would do you some good. Either get outside tomorrow or invent a computer screen that gives you a tan." "That's not a bad idea," he said, looking impressed. "You should patent that." He laughed and then returned his attention to the matter at hand. "So you're clear on the order of events for Saturday night?" Ambra nodded, glancing down at the script. "I welcome people inside the anteroom, and then we all move into this auditorium for your introductory video, after which you magically appear at the podium over there." She pointed to the front of the room. "And then, at the podium, you make your announcement." "Perfect," Edmond said, "with one small addition." He grinned. "When I speak at the podium, it will be more of an intermission �a chance for me to welcome my guests in person, let everyone stretch their legs, and prep them a bit more before I begin the second half of the evening�a multimedia presentation that explains my discovery." "So the announcement itself is prerecorded? Like the intro?" "Yes, I just finished it a few days ago. We're a visual culture�multimedia presentations are always more gripping than some scientist talking at a podium." "You're not exactly �just some scientist,"' Ambra said, "but I agree. I can't wait to see it." For security purposes, Ambra knew, Edmond's presentation was stored on his own private, trusted, off-site servers. Everything would be live-streamed into the museum projection system from a remote location. "When we're ready for the second half," she asked, "who will activate the presentation, you or me?" "I'll do it myself," he said, pulling out his phone. "With this." He held up his oversized smartphone with its turquoise Gaudi case. "It's all part of the show. I simply dial into my remote server on an encrypted connection ..." Edmond pressed a few buttons and the speakerphone rang once and connected. A computerized female voice answered, "good evening, edmond. i am AWAITING YOUR PASSWORD." Edmond smiled. "And then, with the whole world watching, I simply type my password into my phone, and my discovery is live-streamed to our theater here and, simultaneously, to the entire world." "Sounds dramatic," Ambra said, impressed. "Unless, of course, you forget your password." "That would be awkward, yes." "I trust you've written it down?" she said wryly. "Blasphemy," Edmond said, laughing. "Computer scientists never write down passwords. Not to worry, though. Mine is only forty-seven characters long. I'm sure I won't forget it." Ambra's eyes widened. "Forty-seven?! Edmond, you can't even remember the four-digit PIN for your museum security card! How are you going to remember forty-seven random characters?" He laughed again at her alarm. "I don't have to; they're not random." He lowered his voice. "My password is actually my favorite line of poetry." Ambra felt confused. "You used a line of poetry as a password?" "Why not? My favorite line of poetry has exactly forty-seven letters." "Well, it doesn't sound very secure." "No? You think you can guess my favorite line of poetry?" "I didn't even know you like poetry." "Exactly. Even if someone found out that my password was a line of poetry, and even if someone guessed the exact line out of millions of possibilities, they would still need to guess the very long phone number I use to dial into my secure server." "The phone number you just speed-dialed from your phone?" "Yes, a phone that has its own access PIN and never leaves my breast pocket." Ambra threw up her hands, smiling playfully. "Okay, you're the boss," she said. "By the way, who's your favorite poet?" "Nice try," he said, wagging his finger. "You'll have to wait till Saturday. The line of poetry I've chosen is perfect." He grinned. "It's about the future�a prophecy�and I'm happy to say it's already coming true." Now, as her thoughts returned to the present, Ambra glanced over at Edmond's body, and realized with a rush of panic that she was no longer able to see Langdon. Where is he?! More alarming, she now spotted the second Guardia officer�Agent Diaz� climbing back into the dome through the slit cut into the fabric wall. Diaz scanned the dome and then began moving directly toward Ambra. He'll never let me out of here! Suddenly Langdon was beside her. He placed his hand gently on the small of her back and began guiding her away, the two of them moving briskly toward the far end of the dome�the passageway through which everyone had entered. "Ms. Vidal!" Diaz shouted. "Where are you two going?!" "We'll be right back," Langdon called, hastening her across the deserted expanse, moving in a direct line toward the rear of the room and the exit tunnel. "Mr. Langdon!" It was Agent Fonseca's voice, shouting behind them. "You are forbidden to leave this room!" Ambra felt Langdon's hand pressing more urgently on her back. "Winston," Langdon whispered into his headset. "Now!" A moment later, the entire dome went black. CHAPTER 28 agent fonseca and his partner Diaz dashed through the darkened dome, illuminating the way with their cell-phone flashlights and plunging into the tunnel through which Langdon and Ambra had just disappeared. Halfway up the tunnel, Fonseca found Ambra's phone lying on the carpeted floor. The sight of it stunned him. Ambra jettisoned her phone ? The Guardia Real, with Ambra's permission, used a very simple tracking application to keep tabs on her location at all times. There could be only one explanation for her leaving her phone behind: she wanted to escape their protection. The notion made Fonseca extremely nervous, although not nearly as nervous as the prospect of having to inform his boss that the future queen consort of Spain was now missing. The Guardia commander was obsessive and ruthless when it came to protecting the prince's interests. Tonight, the commander had personally tasked Fonseca with the simplest of directives: "Keep Ambra Vidal safe and out of trouble at all times." I can't keep her safe if I don't know where she is! The two agents hurried on to the end of the tunnel and arrived at the darkened anteroom, which now looked like a convention of ghosts�a host of pale shell� shocked faces illuminated by their cell-phone screens as they communicated to the outside world, relaying what they had just witnessed. "Turn on the lights!" several people were shouting. Fonseca's phone rang, and he answered. "Agent Fonseca, this is museum security," said a young woman in terse Spanish. "We know you've lost lights up there. It appears to be a computer malfunction. We'll have power back momentarily." "Are the internal security feeds still up?" Fonseca demanded, knowing the cameras were all equipped with night vision. "They are, yes." Fonseca scanned the darkened room. "Ambra Vidal just entered the anteroom outside the main theater. Can you see where she went?" "One moment, please." Fonseca waited, heart pounding with frustration. He had just received word that Uber was experiencing difficulties tracking the shooter's getaway car. Could anything else go wrong tonight? Fatefully, tonight was his first time on Ambra Vidal's detail. Normally, as a senior officer, Fonseca was assigned only to Prince Julian himself, and yet, this morning, his boss had taken him aside and informed him: "Tonight, Ms. Vidal will be hosting an event against the wishes of Prince Julian. You will accompany her and make sure she is safe." Fonseca never imagined that the event Ambra was hosting would turn out to be an all-out assault on religion, culminating in a public assassination. He was still trying to digest Ambra's angry refusal to take Prince Julian's concerned call. It all seemed inconceivable, and yet her bizarre behavior was only escalating. By all appearances, Ambra Vidal was attempting to ditch her security detail so she could run off with an American professor. If Prince Julian hears about this ... "Agent Fonseca?" The security woman's voice returned. "We can see that Ms. Vidal and a male companion exited the anteroom. They moved down the catwalk and have just entered the gallery housing Louise Bourgeois's Cells exhibit. Out the door, turn right, second gallery on your right." "Thank you! Keep tracking them!" Fonseca and Diaz ran through the anteroom and exited onto the catwalk. Far below, they could see throngs of guests moving quickly across the lobby toward the exits. To the right, exactly as security had promised, Fonseca saw the opening into a large gallery. The exhibit sign read: cells. The gallery was expansive and housed a collection of strange cage-like enclosures, each containing its own amorphous white sculpture. "Ms. Vidal!" Fonseca shouted. "Mr. Langdon!" Receiving no answer, the two agents began searching. Several rooms behind the Guardia agents, just outside the domed auditorium, Langdon and Ambra were climbing carefully through a maze of scaffolding, making their way silently toward the dimly lit "Exit" sign in the distance. Their actions of the last minute had been a blur�with Langdon and Winston collaborating on a quick deception. On Langdon's cue, Winston had killed the lights and plunged the dome into darkness. Langdon had made a mental snapshot of the distance between their position and the tunnel exit, his estimate nearly perfect. At the mouth of the tunnel, Ambra had hurled her phone into the darkened passageway. Then, rather than entering the passage, they turned around, remaining inside the dome, and doubled back along the inner wall, running their hands along the fabric until they found the torn opening through which the Guardia agent had exited in order to pursue Edmond's killer. After climbing through the opening in the fabric wall, the two made their way to the outer wall of the room and moved toward a lit sign that marked an emergency exit stairwell. Langdon recalled with amazement how quickly Winston had arrived at the decision to help them. "If Edmond's announcement can be triggered by a password," Winston had said, "then we must find it and use it at once. My original directive was to assist Edmond in every way possible to make his announcement tonight a success. Obviously, I have failed him in this, and anything I can do to help rectify that failure I will do." Langdon was about to thank him, but Winston raced on without taking a breath. The words streamed from Winston at an inhumanly fast pace, like an audiobook playing at accelerated speed. "If I myself were able to access Edmond's presentation," Winston said, "I would do so immediately, but as you heard, it is stored in a secure server off-site. It appears that all we require to release his discovery to the world is his customized phone and password. I have already searched all published texts for a forty-seven-letter line of poetry, and unfortunately the possibilities number in the hundreds of thousands, if not more, depending on how one breaks the stanzas. Furthermore, because Edmond's interfaces generally lock out users after a few failed password attempts, a brute-force attack will be impossible. This leaves us only one option: we must find his password in another manner. I am in agreement with Ms. Vidal that you must gain access immediately to Edmond's home in Barcelona. It seems logical that if he had a favorite line of poetry, he would possess a book containing that poem, and perhaps even have highlighted his favorite line in some manner. Therefore, I calculate a very high probability that Edmond would want you to go to Barcelona, find his password, and use it to release his announcement as planned. In addition, I have now determined that the last-minute phone call that requested Admiral Avila be added to the guest list did indeed originate in the Royal Palace in Madrid, as Ms. Vidal stated. For this reason, I have decided that we cannot trust the Guardia Real agents, and I will devise a way to divert them and thereby facilitate your escape." Incredibly, it appeared that Winston had found a way to do just that. Langdon and Ambra had now reached the emergency exit, where Langdon quietly opened the door, ushered Ambra through, and closed the door behind them. "Good," Winston's voice said, materializing again in Langdon's head. "You're in the stairwell." "And the Guardia agents?" Langdon asked. "Far away," Winston replied. "I am currently on the phone with them, posing as a museum security officer and misdirecting them to a gallery at the far end of the building." Incredible, Langdon thought, giving Ambra a reassuring nod. "All good." "Descend the stairs to ground level," Winston said, "and exit the museum. Also, please be advised, once you exit the building, your museum headset will no longer have a connection to me." Damn. The thought had not occurred to Langdon. "Winston," he said hurriedly, "are you aware that Edmond shared his discovery with a number of religious leaders last week?" "That seems unlikely," Winston replied, "although his introduction tonight certainly implied that his work has profound religious implications, so perhaps he wanted to discuss his findings with leaders in that field?" "I think so, yes. One of them, however, was Bishop Valdespino from Madrid." "Interesting. I see numerous references online stating that he is a very close adviser to the king of Spain." "Yes, and one more thing," Langdon said. "Were you aware that Edmond received a threatening voice mail from Valdespino after their meeting?" "I was not. It must have come on a private line." "Edmond played it for me. Valdespino urged him to cancel his presentation and also warned that the clerics with whom Edmond had consulted were considering a preemptive announcement to undermine him somehow before he could go public." Langdon slowed on the stairs, permitting Ambra to press ahead. He lowered his voice. "Did you find any connection between Valdespino and Admiral Avila?" Winston paused a few seconds. "I found no direct connection, but that does not mean one does not exist. It just means it's not documented." They approached the ground floor. "Professor, if I may ...," Winston said. "Considering the events of this evening, logic would suggest that powerful forces are intent on burying Edmond's discovery. Bearing in mind that his presentation named you as the person whose insight helped inspire his breakthrough, Edmond's enemies might consider you a dangerous loose end." Langdon had never considered the possibility and felt a sudden flash of danger as he reached the ground floor. Ambra was already there, heaving open the metal door. "When you exit," Winston said, "you will find yourselves in an alley. Move to your left around the building and proceed down to the river. From there I will facilitate your transportation to the location we discussed." BIO-EC346, Langdon thought, having urged Winston to take them there. The place where Edmond and I were supposed to meet after the event. Langdon had finally deciphered the code, realizing that BIO-EC346 was not some secret science club at all. It was something far more mundane. Nonetheless, he hoped it would be the key to their escape from Bilbao. If we can make it there undetected ..., he thought, knowing there would soon be roadblocks everywhere. We need to move quickly. As Langdon and Ambra stepped over the threshold into the cool night air, Langdon was startled to see what looked like rosary beads scattered across the ground. He didn't have time to wonder why. Winston was still talking. "Once you reach the river," his voice commanded, "go to the walkway beneath La Salve Bridge and wait until�" Langdon's headset blared suddenly with deafening static. "Winston?" Langdon shouted. "Wait until� what?\" But Winston was gone, and the metal door had just slammed shut behind them. CHAPTER 29 miles to the south, on the outskirts of Bilbao, an Uber sedan raced south along Highway AP-68 en route toward Madrid. In the backseat, Admiral Avila had removed his white jacket and naval cap, enjoying a sense of freedom as he sat back and reflected on his simple escape. Precisely as the Regent promised. Almost immediately after entering the Uber vehicle, Avila had drawn his pistol and pressed it against the head of the trembling driver. At Avila's command, the driver had tossed his smartphone out the window, effectively severing his vehicle's only connection with the company's headquarters. Then Avila had gone through the man's wallet, memorizing his home address and the names of his wife and two children. Do as I say, Avila had told him, or your family will die. The man's knuckles had turned white on the steering wheel, and Avila knew he had a devoted driver for the night. I am invisible now, Avila thought as police cars raced by in the opposite direction, sirens wailing. As the car sped south, Avila settled in for the long ride, savoring the afterglow of his adrenaline-fueled high. I have served the cause well, he thought. He glanced at the tattoo on his palm, realizing that the protection it provided had been an unnecessary precaution. At least for now. Feeling confident that his terrified Uber driver would obey orders, Avila lowered his pistol. As the car rushed toward Madrid, he gazed once again at the two stickers on the car's windshield. What are the chances ? he thought. The first sticker was to be expected�the Uber logo. The second sticker, however, could only have been a sign from above. The papal cross. The symbol was everywhere these days�Catholics around Europe showing solidarity with the new pope, praising his sweeping liberalization and modernization of the Church. Ironically, Avila's realization that his driver was a devotee of the liberal pope had made pulling a gun on the man an almost pleasurable experience. Avila was appalled at how the lazy masses adored this new pontiff, who was permitting the followers of Christ to pick and choose from a buffet table of God's laws, deciding which rules were palatable to them and which were not. Almost overnight, inside the Vatican, questions of birth control, gay marriage, female priests, and other liberal causes were all on the table for discussion. Two thousand years of tradition seemed to be evaporating in the blink of an eye. Fortunately, there are still those who fight for the old ways. Avila heard strains of the Oriamendi hymn playing in his mind. And I am honored to serve them. CHAPTER 30 Spain's oldest and most elite security force�the Guardia Real�has a fierce tradition that dates back to medieval times. Guardia agents consider it their sworn duty before God to ensure the safety of the royal family, to protect royal property, and to defend royal honor. Commander Diego Garza�overseer of the Guardia's nearly two thousand troops�was a stunted and weedy sixty-year-old with a swarthy complexion, tiny eyes, and thinning black hair worn slicked back over a mottled scalp. His rodent� like features and diminutive stature made Garza nearly invisible in a crowd, which helped camouflage his enormous influence within the palace walls. Garza had learned long ago that true power stemmed not from physical strength but from political leverage. His command of the Guardia Real troops certainly gave him clout, but it was his prescient political savvy that had established Garza as the palace's go-to man on a wide array of matters, both personal and professional. A reliable curator of secrets, Garza had never once betrayed a confidence. His reputation for steadfast discretion, along with an uncanny ability to solve delicate problems, had made him indispensable to the king. Now, however, Garza and others in the palace faced an uncertain future as Spain's aging sovereign lived out his final days at the Palacio de la Zarzuela. For more than four decades, the king had ruled a turbulent country as it established a parliamentary monarchy following thirty-six years of bloody dictatorship under the ultraconservative general Francisco Franco. Since Franco's death in 1975, the king had tried to work hand in hand with the government to cement Spain's democratic process, inching the country ever so slowly back to the left. For the youth, the changes were too slow. For the aging traditionalists, the changes were blasphemous. Many members of Spain's establishment still fiercely defended Franco's conservative doctrine, especially his view of Catholicism as a "state religion" and moral backbone of the nation. A rapidly growing number of Spain's youth, however, stood in stark opposition to this view�brazenly denouncing the hypocrisy of organized religion and lobbying for greater separation of church and state. Now, with a middle-aged prince poised to ascend to the throne, nobody was certain in which direction the new king would lean. For decades, Prince Julian had done an admirable job of performing his bland ceremonial duties, deferring to his father on matters of politics and never once tipping his hand as to his personal beliefs. While most pundits suspected he would be far more liberal than his father, there was really no way to know for sure. Tonight, however, that veil would be lifted. In light of the shocking events in Bilbao, and the king's inability to speak publicly due to his health, the prince would have no choice but to weigh in on the evening's troubling events. Several high-ranking government officials, including the country's president, had already condemned the murder, shrewdly deferring further comment until the Royal Palace had made a statement�thereby depositing the entire mess in Prince Julian's lap. Garza was not surprised; the involvement of the future queen, Ambra Vidal, made this a political grenade that nobody felt like touching. Prince Julian will be tested tonight, Garza thought, hurrying up the grand staircase toward the palace's royal apartments. He is going to need guidance, and with his father incapacitated, that guidance must come from me. Garza strode the length of the residencia hallway and finally reached the prince's door. He took a deep breath and knocked. Odd, he thought, getting no answer. I know he 's in there. According to Agent Fonseca in Bilbao, Prince Julian had just called from the apartment and was trying to reach Ambra Vidal to make sure she was safe, which, thank heavens, she was. Garza knocked again, feeling rising concern when he again got no answer. Hastily, he unlocked the door. "Don Julian?" he called as he stepped inside. The apartment was dark except for the flickering light of the television in the living room. "Hello?" Garza hurried in and found Prince Julian standing alone in the darkness, a motionless silhouette facing the bay window. He was still impeccably dressed in the tailored suit he had worn to his meetings this evening, having not yet so much as loosened his necktie. Watching in silence, Garza felt unsettled by his prince's trancelike state. This crisis appears to have left him stunned. Garza cleared his throat, making his presence known. When the prince finally spoke, he did so without turning from the window. "When I called Ambra," he said, "she refused to speak to me." Julian's tone sounded more perplexed than hurt. Garza was unsure how to reply. Given the night's events, it seemed incomprehensible that Julian's thoughts were on his relationship with Ambra� an engagement that had been strained right from its poorly conceived beginnings. "I imagine Ms. Vidal is still in shock," Garza offered quietly. "Agent Fonseca will deliver her to you later this evening. You can speak then. And let me just add how relieved I am, knowing that she is safe." Prince Julian nodded absently. "The shooter is being tracked," Garza said, attempting to change the subject. "Fonseca assures me they will have the terrorist in custody soon." He used the word "terrorist" intentionally in hopes of snapping the prince out of his daze. But the prince only gave another blank nod. "The president has denounced the assassination," Garza continued, "but the government does hope that you will further comment ... considering Ambra's involvement with the event." Garza paused. "I realize the situation is awkward, given your engagement, but I would suggest you simply say that one of the things you most admire in your fiancee is her independence, and while you know she doesn't share the political views of Edmond Kirsch, you applaud her standing by her commitments as director of the museum. I'd be happy to write something for you, if you like? We should make a statement in time for the morning news cycle." Julian's gaze never left the window. "I'd like to get Bishop Valdespino's input on any statement we make." Garza clenched his jaw and swallowed his disapproval. Post-Franco Spain was an estado aconfesional, meaning it no longer had a state religion, and the Church was not supposed to have any involvement in political matters. Valdespino's close friendship with the king, however, had always afforded the bishop an unusual amount of influence in the daily affairs of the palace. Unfortunately, Valdespino's hard-line politics and religious zeal left little room for the diplomacy and tact that were required to handle tonight's crisis. We need nuance and finesse�not dogma and fireworks! Garza had learned long ago that Valdespino's pious exterior concealed a very simple truth: Bishop Valdespino always served his own needs before those of God. Until recently, it was something Garza could ignore, but now, with the balance of power shifting in the palace, the sight of the bishop sidling up to Julian was a cause for significant concern. Valdespino is too close to the prince as it is. Garza knew that Julian had always considered the bishop "family"�more of a trusted uncle than a religious authority. As the king's closest confidant, Valdespino had been tasked with overseeing young Julian's moral development, and he had done so with dedication and fervor�vetting all of Julian's tutors, introducing him to the doctrines of faith, and even advising him on matters of the heart. Now, years later, even when Julian and Valdespino did not see eye to eye, their bond remained blood-deep. "Don Julian," Garza said in a calm tone, "I feel strongly that tonight's situation is something you and I should handle alone." "Is it?" declared a man's voice in the darkness behind him. Garza spun around, stunned to see a robed ghost seated in the shadows. Valdespino. "I must say, Commander," Valdespino hissed, "I figured that you of all people would realize how much you need me tonight." "This is a political situation," Garza stated firmly, "not a religious one." Valdespino scoffed. "The fact that you can make such a statement tells me that I have grossly overestimated your political acumen. If you would like my opinion, there is only one appropriate response to this crisis. We must immediately assure the nation that Prince Julian is a deeply religious man, and that Spain's future king is a devout Catholic." "I agree ... and we will include a mention of Don Julian's faith in any statement he makes." "And when Prince Julian appears before the press, he will need me at his side, with my hand on his shoulder�a potent symbol of the strength of his bond with the Church. That single image will do more to reassure the nation than any words you can write." Garza bristled. "The world has just witnessed a brutal live assassination on Spanish soil," Valdespino declared. "In times of violence, nothing comforts like the hand of God." CHAPTER 31 the szechenyi chain Bridge�one of eight bridges in Budapest�spans more than a thousand feet across the Danube. An emblem of the link between East and West, the bridge is considered one of the most beautiful in the world. What am I doing? wondered Rabbi Koves, peering over the railing into the swirling black waters below. The bishop advised me to stay at home. Koves knew he shouldn't have ventured out, and yet whenever he felt unsettled, something about the bridge had always pulled at him. For years, he'd walked here at night to reflect while he admired the timeless view. To the east, in Pest, the illuminated facade of Gresham Palace stood proudly against the bell towers of Szent Istvan Bazilika. To the west, in Buda, high atop Castle Hill, rose the fortified walls of Buda Castle. And northward, on the banks of the Danube, stretched the elegant spires of the parliament building, the largest in all of Hungary. Koves suspected, however, that it was not the view that continually brought him to Chain Bridge. It was something else entirely. The padlocks. All along the bridge's railings and suspension wires hung hundreds of padlocks�each bearing a different pair of initials, each locked forever to the bridge. Tradition was that two lovers would come together on this bridge, inscribe their initials on a padlock, secure the lock to the bridge, and then throw the key into the deep water, where it would be lost forever�a symbol of their eternal connection. The simplest of promises, Koves thought, touching one of the dangling locks. My soul is locked to your soul, forever. Whenever Koves needed to be reminded that boundless love existed in the world, he would come to see these locks. Tonight felt like one of those nights. As he stared down into the swirling water, he felt as if the world were suddenly moving far too fast for him. Perhaps I don't belong here anymore. What had once been life's quiet moments of solitary reflection�a few minutes alone on a bus, or walking to work, or waiting for an appointment�now felt unbearable, and people impulsively reached for their phones, their earbuds, and their games, unable to fight the addictive pull of technology. The miracles of the past were fading away, whitewashed by a ceaseless hunger for all-that-was- new. Now, as Yehuda Koves stared down into the water, he felt increasingly weary. His vision seemed to blur, and he began to see eerie, amorphous shapes moving beneath the water's surface. The river suddenly looked like a churning stew of creatures coming to life in the deep. "A viz el," a voice said behind him. "The water is alive." The rabbi turned and saw a young boy with curly hair and hopeful eyes. The boy reminded Yehuda of himself in younger years. "I'm sorry?" the rabbi said. The boy opened his mouth to speak, but instead of language, an electronic buzzing noise issued from his throat and a blinding white light flashed from his eyes. Rabbi Koves awoke with a gasp, sitting bolt upright in his chair. "Oy gevalt!" The phone on his desk was blaring, and the old rabbi spun around, scanning the study of his haziko in a panic. Thankfully, he was entirely alone. He could feel his heart pounding. Such a strange dream, he thought, trying to catch his breath. The phone was insistent, and Koves knew that at this hour it had to be Bishop Valdespino, calling to provide him with an update on his transportation to Madrid. "Bishop Valdespino," the rabbi answered, still feeling disoriented. "What is the news?" "Rabbi Yehuda Koves?" an unfamiliar voice inquired. "You don't know me, and I don't want to frighten you, but I need you to listen to me carefully." Koves was suddenly wide-awake. The voice was female but was masked somehow, sounding distorted. The caller spoke in rushed English with a slight Spanish accent. "I'm filtering my voice for privacy. I apologize for that, but in a moment, you will understand why." "Who is this?!" Koves demanded. "I am a watchdog�someone who does not appreciate those who try to conceal the truth from the public." "I ... don't understand." "Rabbi Koves, I know you attended a private meeting with Edmond Kirsch, Bishop Valdespino, and Allamah Syed al-Fadl three days ago at the Montserrat monastery." How does she know this?! "In addition, I know Edmond Kirsch provided the three of you with extensive information about his recent scientific discovery ... and that you are now involved in a conspiracy to conceal it." "What?!" "If you do not listen to me very carefully, then I predict you will be dead by morning, eliminated by the long arm of Bishop Valdespino." The caller paused. "Just like Edmond Kirsch and your friend Syed al-Fadl." CHAPTER 32 Bilbao's la salve Bridge crosses the Nervion River in such close proximity to the Guggenheim Museum that the two structures often have the appearance of being fused into one. Immediately recognizable by its unique central support�a towering, bright red stmt shaped like a giant letter H �the bridge takes the name "La Salve" from folkloric tales of sailors returning from sea along this river and saying prayers of gratitude for their safe arrival home. After exiting the rear of the building, Langdon and Ambra had quickly covered the short distance between the museum and the riverbank and were now waiting, as Winston had requested, on a walkway in the shadows directly beneath the bridge. Waiting for what? Langdon wondered, uncertain. As they lingered in the darkness, he could see Ambra's slender frame shivering beneath her sleek evening dress. He removed his tails jacket and placed it around her shoulders, smoothing the fabric down her arms. Without warning, she suddenly turned and faced him. For an instant, Langdon feared he had overstepped a boundary, but Ambra's expression was not one of displeasure, but rather one of gratitude. "Thank you," she whispered, gazing up at him. "Thank you for helping me." With her eyes locked on his, Ambra Vidal reached out, took Langdon's hands, and clasped them in her own, as if she were trying to absorb any warmth or comfort he could offer. Then, just as quickly, she released them. "Sorry," she whispered. "Conducta impropia, as my mother would say." Langdon gave her a reassuring grin. "Extenuating circumstances, as my mother would say." She managed a smile, but it was short-lived. "I feel absolutely ill," she said, glancing away. "Tonight, what happened to Edmond ..." "It's appalling ... dreadful," Langdon said, knowing he was still too much in shock to express his emotions fully. Ambra was staring at the water. "And to think that my fiance, Don Julian, is involved ..." Langdon could hear the betrayal in her voice and was uncertain how to reply. "I realize how it appears," he said, treading lightly on this delicate ground, "but we really don't know that for sure. It's possible Prince Julian had no advance notice about the killing tonight. The assassin could have been acting alone, or working for someone other than the prince. It makes little sense that the future king of Spain would orchestrate the public assassination of a civilian�especially one traceable directly back to him." "It's only traceable because Winston figured out that Avila was a late addition to the guest list. Maybe Julian thought nobody would ever figure out who pulled the trigger." Langdon had to admit she had a point. "I never should have discussed Edmond's presentation with Julian," Ambra said, turning back to him. "He was urging me not to participate, and so I tried to reassure him that my involvement would be minimal, that it was all nothing but a video screening. I think I even told Julian that Edmond was launching his discovery from a smartphone." She paused. "Which means, if they see that we took Edmond's phone, they'll realize that his discovery can still be broadcast. And I really don't know how far Julian will go to interfere." Langdon studied the beautiful woman a long moment. "You don't trust your fiance at all, do you?" Ambra took a deep breath. "The truth is, I don't know him as well as you might assume." "Then why did you agree to marry him?" "Quite simply, Julian put me in a position where I had no choice." Before Langdon could respond, a low rumble began shaking the cement beneath their feet, reverberating through the grotto-like space beneath the bridge. The sound grew louder and louder. It seemed to be coming from up the river, to their right. Langdon turned and saw a dark shape speeding toward them�a powerboat approaching with no running lights. As it neared the high cement bank, it slowed and began to glide up perfectly beside them. Langdon stared down at the craft and shook his head. Until this moment, he had been unsure how much faith to place in Edmond's computerized docent, but now, seeing a yellow water taxi approaching the bank, he realized that Winston was the best ally they could possibly have. The disheveled captain waved them aboard. "Your British man, he call me," the man said. "He say VIP client pay triple for ... how you say ... velocidad y discrecion ? I do it�you see? No lights!" "Yes, thank you," Langdon replied. Good call, Winston. Speed and discretion. The captain reached out and helped Ambra aboard, and as she disappeared into the small covered cabin to get warm, he gave Langdon a wide-eyed smile. "This my VIP? Senorita Ambra Vidal?" "Velocidad y discretion," Langdon reminded him. "]Si, si! Okay!" The man scurried to the helm and revved the engines. Moments later, the powerboat was skimming westward through the darkness along the Nervion River. Off the port side of the boat, Langdon could see the Guggenheim's giant black widow, eerily illuminated by the spinning lights of police cars. Overhead, a news chopper streaked across the sky toward the museum. The first of many, Langdon suspected. Langdon pulled Edmond's cryptic note card from his pants pocket. BIO- EC346. Edmond had told him to give it to a taxi driver, although Edmond probably never imagined the vehicle would be a water taxi. "Our British friend ...," Langdon yelled to the driver over the sound of the roaring engines. "I assume he told you where we are going?" "Yes, yes! I warn him by boat I can take you only almost there, but he say no problem, you walk three hundred meters, no?" "That's fine. And how far is it from here?" The man pointed to a highway that ran along the river on the right. "Road sign say seven kilometers, but in boat, a little more." Langdon glanced out at the illuminated highway sign. AEROPUERTO BILBAO (BIO) 7 KM He smiled ruefully at the sound of Edmond's voice in his mind. It's a painfully simple code, Robert. Edmond was right, and when Langdon had finally figured it out earlier tonight, he had been embarrassed that it had taken him so long. BIO was indeed a code�although it was no more difficult to decipher than similar codes from around the world: BOS, LAX, JFK. BIO is the local airport code. The rest of Edmond's code had fallen into place instantly. EC346. Langdon had never seen Edmond's private jet, but he knew the plane existed, and he had little doubt that the country code for a Spanish jet's tail number would start with the letter E for Espana. EC346 is a private jet. Clearly, if a cabdriver had taken him to Bilbao Airport, Langdon could have presented Edmond's card to security and been escorted directly to Edmond's private plane. I hope Winston reached the pilots to warn them we are coming, Langdon thought, looking back in the direction of the museum, which was growing smaller and smaller in their wake. Langdon considered going inside the cabin to join Ambra, but the fresh air felt good, and he decided to give her a couple of minutes alone to gather herself. I could use a moment too, he thought, moving toward the bow. At the front of the boat, with the wind whipping through his hair, Langdon untied his bow tie and pocketed it. Then he released the top button of his wingtip collar and breathed as deeply as he could, letting the night air fill his lungs. Edmond, he thought. What have you done? CHAPTER 33 commander diego garza was fuming as he paced the darkness of Prince Julian's apartment and endured the bishop's self-righteous lecture. You are trespassing where you do not belong, Garza wanted to shout at Valdespino. This is not your domain! Once again, Bishop Valdespino had inserted himself into palace politics. Having materialized like a specter in the darkness of Julian's apartment, Valdespino was adorned in full ecclesiastical vestments and was now giving an impassioned sermon to Julian about the importance of Spain's traditions, the devoted religiosity of past kings and queens, and the comforting influence of the Church in times of crisis. This is not the moment, Garza seethed. Tonight, Prince Julian would need to deliver a delicate public relations performance, and the last thing Garza needed was to have him distracted by Valdespino's attempts to impose a religious agenda. The buzz of Garza's phone conveniently interrupted the bishop's monologue. "Si, dime," Garza answered loudly, positioning himself between the prince and the bishop. "<? Que tal va?" "Sir, it's Agent Fonseca in Bilbao," the caller said in rapid-fire Spanish. "I'm afraid we've been unable to capture the shooter. The car company we thought could track him has lost contact. The shooter seems to have anticipated our actions." Garza swallowed his anger and exhaled calmly, trying to ensure that his voice would reveal nothing about his true state of mind. "I understand," he replied evenly. "At the moment, your only concern is Ms. Vidal. The prince is waiting to see her, and I've assured him that you'll have her here shortly." There was a long silence on the line. Too long. "Commander?" Fonseca asked, sounding tentative. "I'm sorry, sir, but I have bad news on that front. It appears that Ms. Vidal and the American professor have left the building"�he paused�"without us." Garza almost dropped his phone. "I'm sorry, can you ... repeat that?" "Yes, sir. Ms. Vidal and Robert Langdon have fled the building. Ms. Vidal intentionally abandoned her phone so we would be unable to track her. We have no idea where they've gone." Garza realized his jaw had fallen slack, and the prince was now staring at him with apparent concern. Valdespino was also leaning in to hear, his eyebrows arched with unmistakable interest. "Ah�that's excellent news!" Garza blurted suddenly, nodding with conviction. "Good work. We'll see you all here later this evening. Let's just confirm transport protocols and security. One moment, please." Garza covered the phone and smiled at the prince. "All is well. I'll just step into the other room to sort out the details so that you gentlemen can have some privacy." Garza was reluctant to leave the prince alone with Valdespino, but this was not a call he could take in front of either of them, so he walked to one of the guest bedrooms, stepped inside, and closed the door. "iQue diablos ha pasado?" he seethed into the phone. What the hell happened? Fonseca relayed a story that sounded like utter fantasy. "The lights went out?" Garza demanded. "A computer posed as a security officer and gave you bad intel? How am I supposed to respond to that?" "I realize it is hard to imagine, sir, but that is precisely what happened. What we are struggling to understand is why the computer had a sudden change of heart." "Change of heart?! It's a goddamned computer!" "What I mean is that the computer had previously been helpful�identifying the shooter by name, attempting to thwart the assassination, and also discovering that the getaway vehicle was an Uber car. Then, very suddenly, it seemed to be working against us. All we can figure is that Robert Langdon must have said something to it, because after its conversation with him, everything changed." Now I'm battling a computer? Garza decided he was getting too old for this modern world. "I'm sure I don't need to tell you, Agent Fonseca, how embarrassing this would be for the prince both personally and politically if it were known that his fiancee had fled with the American, and that the prince's Guardia Real had been tricked by a computer." "We are acutely aware of that." "Do you have any idea what would inspire the two of them to run away? It seems entirely unwarranted and reckless." "Professor Langdon was quite resistant when I told him he would be joining us in Madrid this evening. He made it clear he did not want to come." And so he fled a murder scene? Garza sensed something else was going on, but he could not imagine what. "Listen to me carefully. It is absolutely critical that you locate Ambra Vidal and bring her back to the palace before any of this information leaks out." "I understand, sir, but Diaz and I are the only two agents on the scene. We can't possibly search all of Bilbao alone. We'll need to alert the local authorities, gain access to traffic cams, air support, every possible�" "Absolutely not!" Garza replied. "We can't afford the embarrassment. Do your job. Find them on your own, and return Ms. Vidal to our custody as quickly as possible." "Yes, sir." Garza hung up, incredulous. As he stepped out of the bedroom, a pale young woman hurried up the hallway toward him. She was wearing her usual techie Coke-bottle glasses and beige pantsuit, and was anxiously clutching a computer tablet. God save me, Garza thought. Not now. Monica Martin was the palace's newest and youngest-ever "public relations coordinator"�a post that included the duties of media liaison, PR strategist, and communications director�which Martin seemed to carry out in a permanent state of high alert. At only twenty-six years of age, Martin held a communications degree from Madrid's Complutense University, had done two years of postgrad work at one of the top computer schools in the world�Tsinghua University in Beijing�and then had landed a high-powered PR job at Grupo Planeta followed by a top "communications" post at Spanish television network Antena 3. Last year, in a desperate attempt to connect via digital media with the young people of Spain, and to keep up with the mushrooming influence of Twitter, Facebook, blogs, and online media, the palace had fired a seasoned PR professional with decades of print and media experience and replaced him with this tech-sawy millennial. Martin owes everything to Prince Julian, Garza knew. The young woman's appointment to the palace staff had been one of Prince Julian's few contributions to palace operations�a rare instance when he flexed his muscle with his father. Martin was considered one of the best in the business, but Garza found her paranoia and nervous energy utterly exhausting. "Conspiracy theories," Martin announced to him, waving her tablet as she arrived. "They're exploding all over." Garza stared at his PR coordinator in disbelief. Do I look like I care? He had more important things to worry about tonight than the conspiratorial rumor mill. "Would you mind telling me what you are doing strolling through the royal residence!" "The control room just pinged your GPS." She pointed to the phone on Garza's belt. Garza closed his eyes and exhaled, swallowing his irritation. In addition to a new PR coordinator, the palace had recently implemented a new "division of electronic security," which supported Garza's team with GPS services, digital surveillance, profiling, and preemptive data mining. Every day, Garza's staff was more diverse and youthful. Our control room looks like a college campus computer center. Apparently, the newly implemented technology used to track Guardia agents was also tracking Garza himself. It felt unnerving to think that a bunch of kids in the basement knew his whereabouts at every instant. "I came to you personally," Martin said, holding out her tablet, "because I knew you'd want to see this." Garza snatched the device from her and eyed the screen, seeing a stock photo and bio of the silver-bearded Spaniard who had been identified as the Bilbao shooter�royal navy admiral Luis Avila. "There's a lot of damaging chatter," said Martin, "and much is being made of Avila's being a former employee of the royal family." "Avila worked for the navy!" Garza spluttered. "Yes, but technically, the king is the commander of the armed forces�" "Stop right there," Garza ordered, shoving the tablet back at her. "Suggesting the king is somehow complicit in a terrorist act is an absurd stretch made by conspiracy nuts, and is wholly irrelevant to our situation tonight. Let's just count our blessings and get back to work. After all, this lunatic could have killed the queen consort but chose instead to kill an American atheist. All in all, not a bad outcome!" The young woman didn't flinch. "There's something else, sir, which relates to the royal family. I didn't want you to be blindsided." As Martin spoke, her fingers flew across the tablet, navigating to another site. "This is a photo that has been online for a few days, but nobody noticed it. Now, with everything about Edmond Kirsch going viral, this photo is starting to appear in the news." She handed Garza the tablet. Garza eyed a headline: "Is This the Last Photo Taken of Luturist Edmond Kirsch?" A blurry photograph showed Kirsch dressed in a dark suit, standing on a rocky bluff beside a perilous cliff. "The photo was taken three days ago," Martin said, "while Kirsch was visiting the Abbey of Montserrat. A worker on-site recognized Kirsch and snapped a photo. After Kirsch's murder tonight, the worker re-posted the photo as one of the last ever taken of the man." "And this relates to us, how?" Garza asked pointedly. "Scroll down to the next photo." Garza scrolled down. On seeing the second image, he had to reach out and steady himself on the wall. "This ... this can't be true." In this wider-frame version of the same shot, Edmond Kirsch could be seen standing beside a tall man wearing a traditional Catholic purple cassock. The man was Bishop Valdespino. "It's true, sir," Martin said. "Valdespino met with Kirsch a few days ago." "But ..." Garza hesitated, momentarily speechless. "But why wouldn't the bishop have mentioned this? Especially considering all that has happened tonight!" Martin gave a suspicious nod. "That's why I chose to speak to you first." Valdespino met with Kirsch! Garza could not quite wrap his mind around it. And the bishop declined to mention it? The news was alarming, and Garza felt eager to warn the prince. "Unfortunately," the young woman said, "there's a lot more." She began manipulating her tablet again. "Commander?" Valdespino's voice called suddenly from the living room. "What is the news on Ms. Vidal's transport?" Monica Martin's head snapped up, eyes wide. "Is that the bishop?" she whispered. "Valdespino is here in the residence?" "Yes. Counseling the prince." "Commander!" Valdespino called again. "Are you there?" "Believe me," Martin whispered, her tone panicked, "there is more information that you must have right away�before you say another word to the bishop or the prince. Trust me when I tell you that tonight's crisis impacts us far more deeply than you can imagine." Garza studied his PR coordinator a moment and made his decision. "Downstairs in the library. I'll meet you there in sixty seconds." Martin nodded and slipped away. Alone now, Garza took a deep breath and forced his features to relax, hoping to erase all traces of his growing anger and confusion. Calmly, he strolled back into the living room. "All is well with Ms. Vidal," Garza announced with a smile as he entered. "She'll be here later. I'm headed down to the security office to confirm her transportation personally." Garza gave Julian a confident nod and then turned to Bishop Valdespino. "I'll be back shortly. Don't go away." With that, he turned and strode out. As Garza exited the apartment, Bishop Valdespino stared after him, frowning. "Is something wrong?" the prince asked, eyeing the bishop closely. "Yes," Valdespino replied, turning back to Julian. "I've been taking confessions for fifty years. I know a lie when I hear one."

CHAPTER 35 ambra vidal stood alone in the cabin of the water taxi, clutching Robert Langdon's jacket around her. Minutes ago, when Langdon asked why she had agreed to marry a man she barely knew, Ambra had replied truthfully. I was given no choice. Her engagement to Julian was a misfortune she could not bear to relive tonight, not with everything else that had happened. I was trapped. I'm still trapped. Now, as Ambra looked at her own reflection in the dirty window, she felt an overwhelming sense of loneliness engulf her. Ambra Vidal was not one to indulge in self-pity, but at the moment her heart felt brittle and adrift. I'm engaged to a man who is involved somehow in a brutal murder. The prince had sealed Edmond's fate with a single phone call only an hour before the event. Ambra had been frantically preparing for the arrival of the guests when a young staff member had rushed in, excitedly waving a slip of paper. "jSehora Vidal! \Mensaje para ustedl" The girl was giddy and explained in breathless Spanish that an important call had just come in to the museum's front desk. "Our caller ID," she squeaked, "said Royal Palace of Madrid, and so of course I answered! And it was someone calling from the office of Prince Julian!" "They called the front desk?" Ambra asked. "They have my cell number." "The prince's assistant said he tried your mobile," the staffer explained, "but they couldn't get through." Ambra checked her phone. Odd. No missed call. Then she realized that some technicians had just been testing the museum's cellular jamming system, and Julian's assistant must have called while her phone was disabled. "It seems the prince got a call today from a very important friend in Bilbao who wants to attend tonight's event." The girl handed Ambra the slip of paper. "He hoped you would be able to add one name to tonight's guest list?" Ambra eyed the message. Almirante Luis Avila (ret.) Armada Espahola A retired officer from the Spanish navy? "They left a number and said you can call back directly if you want to discuss it, but that Julian was about to go into a meeting, so you probably won't reach him. But the caller insisted that the prince does hope this request is not an imposition." An imposition? Ambra smoldered. Considering what you've already put me through ? "ITl take care of it," Ambra said. "Thank you." The young staffer danced away as if she'd just relayed the word of God Himself. Ambra glared at the prince's request, irritated that he would think it appropriate to exert his influence with her in this way, especially after lobbying so hard against her participation in tonight's event. Once again, you leave me no choice, she thought. If she ignored this request, the result would be an uncomfortable confrontation with a prominent naval officer at the front door. Tonight's event was meticulously choreographed and would attract unparalleled media coverage. The last thing I need is an embarrassing tussle with one of Julian's high-powered friends. Admiral Avila had not been vetted or placed on the "cleared" list, but Ambra suspected that demanding a security check was both unnecessary and potentially insulting. After all, the man was a distinguished naval officer with enough power to pick up the phone, call the Royal Palace, and ask the future king for a favor. And so, facing a tight schedule, Ambra made the only decision she could make. She wrote Admiral Avila's name on the guest list at the front door, and also added it to the docenting database so a headset could be initialized for this new guest. Then she went back to work. And now Edmond is dead, Ambra reflected, returning to the present moment in the darkness of the water taxi. As she tried to rid her mind of the painful memories, a strange thought occurred to her. I never spoke directly to Julian ... the entire message was relayed through third parties. The notion brought with it a small ray of hope. Is it possible that Robert is right? And that maybe Julian is innocent? She considered it a moment longer and then hurried outside. She found the American professor standing alone on the bow, hands on the railing as he stared out into the night. Ambra joined him there, startled to see that the boat had left the main branch of the Nervion River and was now skimming northward along a small tributary that seemed less of a river than a perilous channel with high muddy banks. The shallow water and tight quarters made Ambra nervous, but their boat captain seemed unfazed, racing along the narrow gorge at top speed, his headlight blazing the way. She quickly told Langdon about the call from Prince Julian's office. "All I really know is that the museum's front desk got a call that originated in the Royal Palace of Madrid. Technically, that call could have been from anyone there claiming to be Julian's assistant." Langdon nodded. "That may be why the person chose to relay the request to you rather than talk to you directly. Any idea who might be involved?" Considering Edmond's history with Valdespino, Langdon was inclined to look toward the bishop himself. "It could be anybody," Ambra said. "It's a delicate time in the palace right now. With Julian taking center stage, a lot of the old advisers are scrambling to find favor and gain Julian's ear. The country is changing, and I think a lot of the old guard are desperate to retain power." "Well, whoever is involved," Langdon said, "let's hope they don't figure out we're trying to locate Edmond's password and release his discovery." As he spoke the words, Langdon felt the stark simplicity of their challenge. He also sensed its blunt peril. Edmond was murdered to keep this information from being released. For an instant, Langdon wondered if his safest option might be simply to fly directly home from the airport and let someone else handle all this. Safe, yes, he thought, but an option ...no. Langdon felt a profound sense of duty toward his old student, along with moral outrage that a scientific breakthrough could be so brutally censored. He also felt a deep intellectual curiosity to learn exactly what Edmond had discovered. And finally, Langdon knew, there is Ambra Vidal. The woman was clearly in crisis, and when she had looked into his eyes and pleaded for help, Langdon had sensed in her a deep well of personal conviction and self-reliance ... yet he had also seen heavy clouds of fear and regret. There are secrets there, he sensed, dark and confining. She is reaching out for help. Ambra raised her eyes suddenly, as if sensing Langdon's thoughts. "You look cold," she said. "You need your jacket back." He smiled softly. "I'm fine." "Are you thinking you should leave Spain as soon as we get to the airport?" Langdon laughed. "Actually, that did cross my mind." "Please don't." She reached out to the railing and placed her soft hand on top of his. "I'm not sure what we're facing tonight. You were close to Edmond, and he told me more than once how much he valued your friendship and trusted your opinion. I'm scared, Robert, and I really don't think I can face this alone." Ambra's flashes of unguarded candor were startling to Langdon, and yet also utterly captivating. "Okay," he said, nodding. "You and I owe it to Edmond and, frankly, to the scientific community, to find that password and make his work public." Ambra smiled softly. "Thank you." Langdon glanced behind the boat. "I imagine your Guardia agents have realized by now that we've left the museum." "No doubt. But Winston was quite impressive, wasn't he?" "Mind-boggling," Langdon replied, only now starting to grasp the quantum leap Edmond had made in the development of AI. Whatever Edmond's "proprietary breakthrough technologies" had been, clearly he had been poised to usher in a brave new world of human-computer interaction. Tonight, Winston had proven himself a faithful servant to his creator as well as an invaluable ally to Langdon and Ambra. In a matter of minutes, Winston had identified a threat on the guest list, attempted to thwart Edmond's assassination, identified the getaway car, and facilitated Langdon and Ambra's escape from the museum. "Let's hope Winston phoned ahead to alert Edmond's pilots," Langdon said. "I'm sure he did," Ambra said. "But you're right. I should call Winston to double-check." "Hold on," Langdon said, surprised. "You can call Winston? When we left the museum and went out of range, I thought ..." Ambra laughed and shook her head. "Robert, Winston is not physically located inside the Guggenheim; he is located in a secret computer facility somewhere and accessed remotely. Do you really think Edmond would build a resource like Winston and not be able to communicate with him at all times, anywhere in the world? Edmond talked to Winston all the time�at home, traveling, out for walks�the two of them could connect at any moment with a simple phone call. I've seen Edmond chat for hours with Winston. Edmond used him like a personal assistant�to call for dinner reservations, to coordinate with his pilots, to do anything that needed doing, really. In fact, when we were mounting the museum show, I talked to Winston quite often myself by phone." Ambra reached inside the pocket of Langdon's tails jacket and pulled out Edmond's turquoise-covered phone, flicking it on. Langdon had powered it down in the museum to save its battery. "You should turn on your phone too," she said, "so we both have access to Winston." "You're not worried about being tracked if we turn these on?" Ambra shook her head. "The authorities haven't had time to get the necessary court order, so I think it's worth the risk�especially if Winston can update us on the Guardia's progress and the situation at the airport." Uneasy, Langdon turned on his phone and watched it come to life. As the home screen materialized, he squinted into the light and felt a twinge of vulnerability, as if he had just become instantly locatable to every satellite in space. You 've seen too many spy movies, he told himself. All at once, Langdon's phone began pinging and vibrating as a backlog of messages from this evening began pouring in. To his astonishment, Langdon had received more than two hundred texts and e-mails since turning off his phone. As he scanned the in-box, he saw the messages were all from friends and colleagues. The earlier e-mails had congratulatory header lines� Great lecture! I can't believe you're there! �but then, very suddenly, the tone of the headers turned anxious and deeply concerned, including a message from his book editor, Jonas Laukman: MY GOD�ROBERT, ARE YOU OKAY??!! Langdon had never seen his scholarly editor employ all caps or double punctuation. Until now, Langdon had been feeling wonderfully invisible in the darkness of Bilbao's waterways, as if the museum were a fading dream. It's all over the world, he realized. News of Kirsch's mysterious discovery and brutal murder ... along with my name and face. "Winston has been trying to reach us," Ambra said, staring into the glow of Kirsch's cell phone. "Edmond has received fifty-three missed calls in the last half hour, all from the same number, all exactly thirty seconds apart." She chuckled. "Tireless persistence is among Winston's many virtues." Just then, Edmond's phone began ringing. Langdon smiled at Ambra. "I wonder who it is." She held out the phone to him. "Answer it." Langdon took the phone and pressed the speaker button. "Hello?" "Professor Langdon," chimed Winston's voice with its familiar British accent. "I'm glad we're back in contact. I've been trying to reach you." "Yes, we can see that," Langdon replied, impressed that the computer sounded so utterly calm and unmffled after fifty-three consecutive failed calls. "There have been some developments," Winston said. "There is a possibility that the airport authorities will be alerted to your names before you arrive. Once again, I will suggest you follow my directions very carefully." "We're in your hands, Winston," Langdon said. "Tell us what to do." "First thing, Professor," Winston said, "if you have not yet jettisoned your cell phone, you need to do so immediately." "Really?" Langdon gripped his phone more tightly. "Don't the authorities need a court order before anyone�" "On an American cop show perhaps, but you are dealing with Spain's Guardia Real and the Royal Palace. They will do what is necessary." Langdon eyed his phone, feeling strangely reluctant to part with it. My whole life is in there. "What about Edmond's phone?" Ambra asked, sounding alarmed. "Untraceable," Winston replied. "Edmond was always concerned about hacking and corporate espionage. He personally wrote an IMEI/IMSI veiling program that varies his phone's C2 values to outsmart any GSM interceptors." Of course he did, Langdon thought. For the genius who created Winston, outsmarting a local phone company would be a cakewalk. Langdon frowned at his own apparently inferior phone. Just then Ambra reached over and gently pried it from his hands. Without a word, she held it over the railing and let go. Langdon watched the phone plummet down and splash into the dark waters of the Nervion River. As it disappeared beneath the surface, he felt a pang of loss, staring back after it as the boat raced on. "Robert," Ambra whispered, "just remember the wise words of Disney's Princess Elsa." Langdon turned. "I'm sorry?" Ambra smiled softly. "Let it go." CHAPTER 36 "su mision todavia no ha terminado," declared the voice on Avila's phone. Your mission is not yet complete. Avila sat up at attention in the backseat of the Uber as he listened to his employer's news. "We've had an unexpected complication," his contact said in rapid Spanish. "We need you to redirect to Barcelona. Right away." Barcelona? Avila had been told he would be traveling to Madrid for further service. "We have reason to believe," the voice continued, "that two associates of Mr. Kirsch are traveling to Barcelona tonight in hopes of finding a way to trigger Mr. Kirsch's presentation remotely." Avila stiffened. "Is that possible ?" "We're not sure yet, but if they succeed, obviously it will undo all of your hard work. I need a man on the ground in Barcelona right away. Discreetly. Get there as fast as you can, and call me." With that, the connection was terminated. The bad news felt strangely welcome to Avila. I am still needed. Barcelona was farther than Madrid but still only a few hours at top speed on a superhighway in the middle of the night. Without wasting a moment, Avila raised his gun and pressed it against the Uber driver's head. The man's hands tensed visibly on the wheel. "Llevame a Barcelona," Avila commanded. The driver took the next exit, toward Vitoria-Gasteiz, eventually accelerating onto the A-l highway, heading east. The only other vehicles on the road at this hour were thundering tractor trailers, all racing to complete their runs to Pamplona, to Huesca, to Lleida, and finally to one of the largest port cities on the Mediterranean Sea�Barcelona. Avila could scarcely believe the strange sequence of events that had brought him to this moment. From the depths of my deepest despair, I have risen to the moment of my most glorious service. For a dark instant, Avila was back in that bottomless pit, crawling across the smoke-filled altar at the Cathedral of Seville, searching the bloodstained rubble for his wife and child, only to realize they were gone forever. For weeks after the attack, Avila did not leave his home. He lay trembling on his couch, consumed by an endless waking nightmare of fiery demons that dragged him into a dark abyss, shrouding him in blackness, rage, and suffocating guilt. "The abyss is purgatory," a nun whispered beside him, one of the hundreds of grief counselors trained by the Church to assist survivors. "Your soul is trapped in a dark limbo. Absolution is the only escape. You must find a way to forgive the people who did this, or your rage will consume you whole." She made the sign of the cross. "Forgiveness is your only salvation." Forgiveness? Avila tried to speak, but demons clenched his throat. At the moment, revenge felt like the only salvation. But revenge against whom? Responsibility for the bombing had never been claimed. "I realize acts of religious terrorism seem unforgivable," the nun continued. "And yet, it may be helpful to remember that our own faith waged a centuries- long Inquisition in the name of our God. We killed innocent women and children in the name of our beliefs. For this, we have had to ask forgiveness from the world, and from ourselves. And through time, we have healed." Then she read to him from the Bible: "'Do not resist an evil person. Whoever slaps you on your right cheek, turn the other to him. Love your enemies, do good to those who hate you, bless those who curse you, pray for those who mistreat you.'" That night, alone and in pain, Avila stared into the mirror. The man looking back at him was a stranger. The nun's words had done nothing to ease his pain. Forgiveness? Turn my other cheek! I have witnessed evil for which there is no absolution! In a growing rage, Avila drove his fist into the mirror, shattering the glass, and collapsing in sobs of anguish on his bathroom floor. As a career naval officer, Avila had always been a man in control�a champion of discipline, honor, and the chain of command�but that man was gone. Within weeks, Avila had fallen into a haze, anesthetizing himself with a potent blend of alcohol and prescription drugs. Soon his yearning for the numbing effects of chemicals occupied every waking hour, diminishing him to a hostile recluse. Within months, the Spanish navy had quietly forced him to retire. A once powerful battleship now stuck in dry dock, Avila knew he would never sail again. The navy to which he had given his life had left him with only a modest stipend on which he could barely live. Fm fifty-eight years old, he realized. And I have nothing. He spent his days sitting alone in his living room, watching TV, drinking vodka, and waiting for any ray of light to appear. La hora mas oscura es justo antes del amanecer, he would tell himself over and over. But the old navy aphorism proved false over and over. The darkest hour is not just before the dawn, he sensed. The dawn is never coming. On his fifty-ninth birthday, a rainy Thursday morning, staring at an empty bottle of vodka and an eviction warning, Avila mustered the courage to go to his closet, take down his navy service pistol, load it, and put the barrel to his temple. "Perdoname," he whispered, and closed his eyes. Then he squeezed the trigger. The explosion was far quieter than he imagined. More of a click than a gunshot. Cruelly, the gun had failed to fire. Years in a dusty closet without being cleaned had apparently taken a toll on the admiral's cheap ceremonial pistol. It seemed even this simple act of cowardice was beyond Avila's abilities. Enraged, he hurled the gun at the wall. This time, an explosion rocked the room. Avila felt a searing heat rip through his calf, and his drunken fog lifted in a flash of blinding pain. He fell to the floor screaming and clutching his bleeding leg. Panicked neighbors pounded on his door, sirens wailed, and Avila soon found himself at Seville's Hospital Provincial de San Lazaro attempting to explain how he had tried to kill himself by shooting himself in the leg. The next morning, as he lay in the recovery room, broken and humiliated, Admiral Luis Avila received a visitor. "You're a lousy shot," the young man said in Spanish. "No wonder they forced you to retire." Before Avila could reply, the man threw open the window shades and let the sunlight pour in. Avila shielded his eyes, now able to see that the kid was muscle-bound and had a buzz cut. He wore a T-shirt with the face of Jesus on it. "My name's Marco," he said, his accent Andaluz. "I'm your trainer for rehab. I asked to be assigned to you because you and I have something in common." "Military?" Avila said, noting his brash demeanor. "Nope." The kid locked eyes with Avila. "I was there that Sunday morning. In the cathedral. The terrorist attack." Avila stared in disbelief. "You were there?" The kid reached down and pulled up one leg of his sweats, revealing a prosthetic limb. "I realize you've been through hell, but I was playing semipro futbol, so don't expect too much sympathy from me. I'm more of a God-helps- those-who-help-themselves kind of guy." Before Avila knew what had happened, Marco heaved him into a wheelchair, rolled him down the hall to a small gym, and propped him up between a pair of parallel bars. "This will hurt," the kid said, "but try to get to the other end. Just do it once. Then you can have breakfast." The pain was excruciating, but Avila was not about to complain to someone with only one leg, so using his arms to bear most of his weight, he shuffled all the way to the end of the bars. "Nice," Marco said. "Now do it again." "But you said�" "Yeah, I lied. Do it again." Avila eyed the kid, stunned. The admiral had not taken an order in years, and strangely, he found something refreshing about it. It made him feel young�the way he had felt as a raw recruit years ago. Avila turned around and began shuffling back the other way. "So tell me," Marco said. "Do you still go to mass at the Seville cathedral?" "Never." "Fear?" Avila shook his head. "Rage." Marco laughed. "Yeah, let me guess. The nuns told you to forgive the attackers?" Avila stopped short on the bars. "Exactly!" "Me too. I tried. Impossible. The nuns gave us terrible advice." He laughed. Avila eyed the young man's Jesus shirt. "But it looks like you're still ..." "Oh yeah, I'm definitely still a Christian. More devout than ever. I was fortunate to find my mission�helping victims of God's enemies." "A noble cause," Avila said enviously, feeling his own life was purposeless without his family or the navy. "A great man helped bring me back to God," Marco continued. "That man, by the way, was the pope. I've met him personally many times." "I'm sorry ... the pope?" "Yes." "As in ... the leader of the Catholic Church?" "Yes. If you like, I could probably arrange an audience for you." Avila stared at the kid as if he'd lost his mind. "You can get me an audience with the pope?" Marco looked hurt. "I realize you're a big naval officer and can't imagine that a crippled physical trainer from Seville has access to the vicar of Christ, but I'm telling you the truth. I can arrange a meeting with him if you like. He could probably help you find your way back, just the way he helped me." Avila leaned on the parallel bars, uncertain how to reply. He idolized the then pope�a staunch conservative leader who preached strict traditionalism and orthodoxy. Unfortunately, the man was under fire from all sides of the modernizing globe, and there were rumblings that he would soon choose to retire in the face of growing liberal pressure. "I'd be honored to meet him, of course, but�" "Good," Marco interjected. "I'll try to set it up for tomorrow." Avila never imagined that the following day he would find himself sitting deep within a secure sanctuary, face-to-face with a powerful leader who would teach him the most empowering religious lesson of his life. The roads to salvation are many. Forgiveness is not the only path. CHAPTER 37 located on the ground floor of the Madrid palace, the royal library is a spectacularly ornate suite of chambers containing thousands of priceless tomes, including Queen Isabella's illuminated Book of Hours, the personal Bibles of several kings, and an iron-bound codex from the era of Alfonso XI. Garza entered in a rush, not wanting to leave the prince alone upstairs in the clutches of Valdespino for too long. He was still trying to make sense of the news that Valdespino had met with Kirsch only days ago and had decided to keep the meeting a secret. Even in light of Kirsch''s presentation and murder tonight? Garza moved across the vast darkness of the library toward PR coordinator Monica Martin, who was waiting in the shadows holding her glowing tablet. "I realize you're busy, sir," Martin said, "but we have a highly time-sensitive situation. I came upstairs to find you because our security center received a disturbing e-mail from ConspiracyNet.com." "From whom?" "ConspiracyNet is a popular conspiracy-theory site. The journalism is shoddy, and it's written at a child's level, but they have millions of followers. If you ask me, they hawk fake news, but the site is quite well respected among conspiracy theorists." In Garza's mind, the terms "well respected" and "conspiracy theory" seemed mutually exclusive. "They've been scooping the Kirsch situation all night," Martin continued. "I don't know where they're getting their information, but the site has become a hub for news bloggers and conspiracy theorists. Even the networks are turning to them for breaking news." "Come to the point," Garza pressed. "ConspiracyNet has new information that relates to the palace," Martin said, pushing her glasses up on her face. "They're going public with it in ten minutes and wanted to give us a chance to comment beforehand." Garza stared at the young woman in disbelief. "The Royal Palace doesn't comment on sensationalist gossip!" "At least look at it, sir." Martin held out her tablet. Garza snatched the screen and found himself looking at a second photo of navy admiral Luis Avila. The photo was uncentered, as if taken by accident, and showed Avila in full dress whites striding in front of a painting. It looked as if it had been taken by a museumgoer who was attempting to photograph a piece of artwork and had inadvertently captured Avila as he blindly stepped into the shot. "I know what Avila looks like," Garza snapped, eager to get back to the prince and Valdespino. "Why are you showing this to me?" "Swipe to the next photo." Garza swiped. The next screen showed an enlargement of the photo�this one focused on the admiral's right hand as it swung out in front of him. Garza immediately saw a marking on Avila's palm. It appeared to be a tattoo. Garza stared at the image for a long moment. The symbol was one he knew well, as did many Spaniards, especially the older generations. The symbol of Franco. Emblazoned in many places in Spain during the middle of the twentieth century, the symbol was synonymous with the ultraconservative dictatorship of General Francisco Franco, whose brutal regime advocated nationalism, authoritarianism, militarism, antiliberalism, and National Catholicism. This ancient symbol, Garza knew, consisted of six letters, which, when put together, spelled a single word in Latin�a word that perfectly defined Franco's self-image. Victor. Ruthless, violent, and uncompromising, Francisco Franco had risen to power with the military support of Nazi Germany and Mussolini's Italy. He killed thousands of his opponents before seizing total control of the country in 1939 and proclaiming himself El Caudillo �the Spanish equivalent of the Fiihrer. During the Civil War and well into the first years of dictatorship, those who dared oppose him disappeared into concentration camps, where an estimated three hundred thousand were executed. Depicting himself as the defender of "Catholic Spain" and the enemy of godless communism, Franco had embraced a starkly male-centric mentality, officially excluding women from many positions of power in society, giving them barely any rights to professorships, judgeships, bank accounts, or even the right to flee an abusive husband. He annulled all marriages that had not been performed according to Catholic doctrine, and, among other restrictions, he outlawed divorce, contraception, abortion, and homosexuality. Fortunately, everything had now changed. Even so, Garza was stunned by how quickly the nation had forgotten one of the darkest periods in its history. Spain's pacto de olvido �a nationwide political agreement to "forget" everything that had happened under Franco's vicious rule�meant that schoolchildren in Spain had been taught very little about the dictator. A poll in Spain had revealed that teenagers were far more likely to recognize the actor James Franco than they were dictator Francisco Franco. The older generations, however, would never forget. This victor symbol� like the Nazi swastika�could still conjure fear in the hearts of those old enough to remember those brutal years. To this day, wary souls warned that the highest reaches of Spanish government and the Catholic Church still harbored a secret faction of Francoist supporters�a hidden fraternity of traditionalists sworn to return Spain to its far-right convictions of the past century. Garza had to admit that there were plenty of old-timers who looked at the chaos and spiritual apathy of contemporary Spain and felt that the country could be saved only by a stronger state religion, a more authoritarian government, and the imposition of clearer moral guidelines. Look at our youth! they would shout. They are all adrift! In recent months, with the Spanish throne soon to be occupied by the younger Prince Julian, there was a rising fear among traditionalists that the Royal Palace itself would soon become another voice for progressive change in the country. Fueling their concern was the prince's recent engagement to Ambra Vidal�who was not only Basque but outspokenly agnostic�and who, as Spain's queen, would no doubt have the prince's ear on matters of church and state. Dangerous days, Garza knew. A contentious cusp between past and future. In addition to a deepening religious rift, Spain faced a political crossroads as well. Would the country retain its monarch? Or would the royal crown be forever abolished as it had been in Austria, Hungary, and so many other European countries? Only time would tell. In the streets, older traditionalists waved Spanish flags, while young progressives proudly wore their antimonarchic colors of purple, yellow, and red�the colors of the old Republican banner. Julian will be inheriting a powder keg. "When I first saw the Franco tattoo," Martin said, drawing Garza's attention back to the tablet, "I thought it might have been digitally added to the photo as a ploy�you know, to stir the pot. Conspiracy sites all compete for traffic, and a Francoist connection will get a massive response, especially considering the anti-Christian nature of Kirsch's presentation tonight." Garza knew she was right. Conspiracy theorists will go crazy over this. Martin motioned to the tablet. "Read the commentary they intend to run." With a feeling of dread, Garza glanced at the lengthy text that accompanied the photo. ConspiracyNet.com EDMOND KIRSCH UPDATE Despite initial suspicions that Edmond Kirsch's murder was the work of religious zealots, the discovery of this ultraconservative Francoist symbol suggests the assassination may have political motivations as well. Suspicions that conservative players in the highest reaches of Spanish government, perhaps even within the Royal Palace itself, are now battling for control in the power vacuum left by the king's absence and imminent death ... "Disgraceful," Garza snapped, having read enough. "All this speculation from a tattoo? It means nothing. With the exception of Ambra Vidal's presence at the shooting, this situation has absolutely nothing to do with the politics of the Royal Palace. No comment." "Sir," Martin pressed. "If you would please read the rest of the commentary, you'll see that they are trying to link Bishop Valdespino directly to Admiral Avila. They're suggesting that the bishop may be a secret Francoist who has been whispering in the king's ear for years, keeping him from making sweeping changes to the country." She paused. "This allegation is gaining a lot of traction online." Once again, Garza found himself at a total loss for words. He no longer recognized the world in which he lived. Fake news now carries as much weight as real news. Garza eyed Martin and did his best to speak calmly. "Monica, this is all a fiction created by blog-writing fantasists for their own amusement. I can assure you that Valdespino is not a Francoist. He has served the king faithfully for decades, and there is no way he is involved with a Francoist assassin. The palace has no comment on any of it. Am I clear?" Garza turned toward the door, eager to get back to the prince and Valdespino. "Sir, wait!" Martin reached out and grabbed his arm. Garza halted, staring down in shock at his young employee's hand. Martin immediately pulled back. "I'm sorry, sir, but ConspiracyNet also sent us a recording of a telephone conversation that just took place in Budapest." She blinked nervously behind her thick glasses. "You're not going to like this either." CHAPTER 38 my boss was assassinated. Captain Josh Siegel could feel his hands trembling on the stick as he taxied Edmond Kirsch's Gulfstream G550 toward the main runway at Bilbao Airport. I'm in no condition to fly, he thought, knowing his copilot was as rattled as he was. Siegel had piloted private jets for Edmond Kirsch for many years, and Edmond's horrifying murder tonight had come as a devastating shock. An hour ago, Siegel and his copilot had been sitting in the airport lounge watching the live feed from the Guggenheim Museum. "Typical Edmond drama," Siegel had joked, impressed by his boss's ability to draw a huge crowd. As he watched Kirsch's program, he found himself, along with the other viewers in the lounge, leaning forward, his curiosity spiking, until, in a flash, the evening went horribly wrong. In the aftermath, Siegel and his copilot sat in a daze, watching the television coverage and wondering what they should do next. Siegel's phone rang ten minutes later; the caller was Edmond's personal assistant, Winston. Siegel had never met him, and although the Brit seemed a bit of an odd duck, Siegel had become quite accustomed to coordinating flights with him. "If you have not seen the television," Winston said, "you should turn it on." "We saw it," Siegel said. "We're both devastated." "We need you to return the plane to Barcelona," Winston said, his tone eerily businesslike considering what had just transpired. "Prepare yourselves for takeoff, and I'll be back in touch shortly. Please do not take off until we speak." Siegel had no idea if Winston's instructions would have aligned with Edmond's wishes, but at the moment, he was thankful for any kind of guidance. On orders from Winston, Siegel and his copilot had filed their flight manifest to Barcelona with zero passengers�a "deadhead" flight, as it was regrettably known in the business�and then had pushed back out of the hangar and begun their preflight checklist. Thirty minutes passed before Winston called back. "Are you prepped for takeoff?" "We are." "Good. I assume you'll be using the usual eastbound runway?" "That's right." Siegel at times found Winston painfully thorough and unnervingly well informed. "Please contact the tower and request clearance to take off. Taxi out to the far end of the airfield, but do not pull onto the runway." "I should stop on the access road?" "Yes, just for a minute. Please alert me when you get there." Siegel and his copilot looked at each other in surprise. Winston's request made no sense at all. The tower might have something to say about that. Nonetheless, Siegel had guided the jet along various ramps and roads toward the runway head at the western edge of the airport. He was now taxiing along the final hundred meters of the access road, where the pavement turned ninety degrees to the right and merged into the eastbound runway head. "Winston?" Siegel said, gazing out at the high chain-link security fence that surrounded the perimeter of the airport property. "We've reached the end of the access ramp." "Please hold there," Winston said. "I'll be back in touch." I can't hold here! Siegel thought, wondering what the hell Winston was doing. Fortunately, the Gulfstream's rearview camera showed no planes behind his, so at least Siegel was not blocking traffic. The only lights were those of the control tower�a faint glow at the other end of the runway, nearly two miles away. Sixty seconds passed. "This is air traffic control," a voice crackled in his headset. "EC346, you are cleared for takeoff on runway number one. I repeat, you are cleared." Siegel wanted nothing more than to take off, but he was still waiting for word from Edmond's assistant. "Thank you, control," he said. "We need to hold here just another minute. We've got a warning light that we're checking." "Roger that. Please advise when ready." CHAPTER 39 "here?" the water taxi's captain looked confused. "You want stop here ? Airport is more far. I take you there." "Thanks, weTl get out here," Langdon said, following Winston's advice. The captain shrugged and brought the boat to a stop beside a small bridge marked Puerto bidea. The riverbank here was covered with high grass and looked more or less accessible. Ambra was already clambering out of the boat and making her way up the incline. "How much do we owe you?" Langdon asked the captain. "No pay," the man said. "Your British man, he pay me before. Credit card. Triple money." Winston paid already. Langdon was still not quite used to working with Kirsch's computerized assistant. It's like having Siri on steroids. Winston's abilities, Langdon realized, should come as no surprise considering daily accounts of artificial intelligence performing all kinds of complex tasks, including writing novels�one such book nearly winning a Japanese literary prize. Langdon thanked the captain and jumped out of the boat onto the bank. Before heading up the hill, he turned back to the bewildered driver, raised his index finger to his lips, and said, "Discrecion, por favor." "Si, si," the captain assured him, covering his eyes. "jNo he visto nada!" With that, Langdon hurried up the slope, crossed a train track, and joined Ambra on the edge of a sleepy village road lined with quaint shops. "According to the map," Winston's voice chimed on Edmond's speakerphone, "you should be at the intersection of Puerto Bidea and the Rio Asua waterway. You should see a small roundabout in the town center?" "I see it," Ambra replied. "Good. Just off the roundabout, you will find a small road called Beike Bidea. Follow it away from the village center." Two minutes later, Langdon and Ambra had left the village and were hurrying along a deserted country road where stone farmhouses sat on acres of grassy pastureland. As they moved deeper into countryside, Langdon sensed that something was wrong. To their right, in the distance, above the crest of a small hill, the sky was aglow with a hazy dome of light pollution. "If those are the terminal lights," Langdon said, "we are very far away." "The terminal is three kilometers from your position," Winston said. Ambra and Langdon exchanged startled looks. Winston had told them the walk would take only eight minutes. "According to Google's satellite images," Winston went on, "there should be a large field to your right. Does it look traversable?" Langdon glanced over at the hayfield to their right, which sloped gently upward in the direction of the terminal lights. "We can certainly climb it," Langdon said, "but three kilometers will take�" "Just climb the hill, Professor, and follow my directions precisely." Winston's tone was polite and as emotionless as ever, and yet Langdon realized he had just been admonished. "Nice job," Ambra whispered, looking amused as she started up the hill. "That's the closest thing to irritation I've ever heard from Winston." "EC346, this is air traffic control," blared the voice in Siegel's headset. "You must either clear the ramp and take off or return to the hangar for repairs. What is your status?" "Still working on it," Siegel lied, glancing at his rearview camera. No planes �only the faint lights of the distant tower. "I just need another minute." "Roger that. Keep us apprised." The copilot tapped Siegel on the shoulder and pointed out through the windshield. Siegel followed his partner's gaze but saw only the high fence in front of the plane. Suddenly, on the other side of the mesh of the barrier, he saw a ghostly vision. What in the world? In the darkened field beyond the fence, two spectral silhouettes were materializing out of the blackness, coming over the crest of a hill and moving directly toward the jet. As the figures drew closer, Siegel saw the distinctive diagonal black sash on a white dress that he had seen earlier on television. Is that Ambra Vidal ? Ambra had flown on occasion with Kirsch, and Siegel always felt his heart flutter a bit when the striking Spanish beauty was aboard. He could not begin to fathom what in the world she was doing in a pasture outside Bilbao Airport. The tall man accompanying Ambra was also wearing formal black-and-white attire, and Siegel recalled that he too had been part of the evening's program. The American professor Robert Langdon. Winston's voice returned suddenly. "Mr. Siegel, you should now see two individuals on the other side of the fence, and you will no doubt recognize both of them." Siegel found the Brit's manner spookily composed. "Please know that there are circumstances tonight that I cannot fully explain, but I am going to ask you to comply with my wishes on behalf of Mr. Kirsch. All you need to know right now is the following." Winston paused for the briefest of moments. "The same people who murdered Edmond Kirsch are now trying to kill Ambra Vidal and Robert Langdon. To keep them safe, we require your assistance." "But... of course," Siegel stammered, trying to process the information. "Ms. Vidal and Professor Langdon need to board your aircraft right now." "Out here?!" Siegel demanded. "I am aware of the technicality posed by a revised passenger manifest, but�" "Are you aware of the technicality posed by a ten-foot-high security fence surrounding the airport?!" "I am indeed," Winston said very calmly. "And, Mr. Siegel, while I realize that you and I have worked together only a few months, I need you to trust me. What I am about to suggest to you is precisely what Edmond would want you to do in this situation." Siegel listened in disbelief as Winston outlined his plan. "What you're suggesting is impossible!" Siegel argued. "On the contrary," Winston said, "it is quite feasible. The thrust of each engine is over fifteen thousand pounds, and your nose cone is designed to endure seven- hundred-mile�" "I'm not worried about the physics of it," Siegel snapped. "I'm worried about the legality �and about having my pilot's license revoked!" "I can appreciate that, Mr. Siegel," Winston responded evenly. "But the future queen consort of Spain is in grave danger right now. Your actions here will help save her life. Believe me, when the truth comes out, you will not be receiving a reprimand, you will be receiving a royal medal from the king." Standing in deep grass, Langdon and Ambra gazed up at the high security fence illuminated in the jet's headlights. At Winston's urging, they stepped back from the fence just as the jet engines revved and the plane began rolling forward. Rather than following the curve of the access ramp, however, the jet continued straight toward them, crossing the painted safety lines and rolling out onto the asphalt skirt. It slowed to a crawl, inching closer and closer to the fence. Langdon could now see that the jet's nose cone was aligned perfectly with one of the fence's heavy steel support posts. As the massive nose cone connected with the vertical post, the jet engines revved ever so slightly. Langdon expected more of a fight, but apparently two Rolls-Royce engines and a forty-ton jet were more than this fence post could take. With a metallic groan, the post tipped toward them, pulling with it a huge mound of asphalt attached to its base like the root ball of a toppled tree. Langdon ran over and grabbed the fallen fence, pulling it down low enough that he and Ambra could make their way across it. By the time they staggered onto the tarmac, the jet's gangway stairs had been deployed and a uniformed pilot was waving them aboard. Ambra eyed Langdon with a tight smile. "Still doubting Winston?" Langdon no longer had any words. As they hurried up the staircase and into the plush interior cabin, Langdon heard the second pilot in the cockpit talking to the tower. "Yes, control, I read you," the pilot was saying, "but your ground radar must be miscalibrated. We did not leave the access ramp. I repeat, we are still squarely on the access ramp. Our warning light is now off, and we're ready for takeoff." The copilot slammed the door as the pilot engaged the Gulfstream's reverse thrust, inching the plane backward, away from the sagging fence. Then the jet began its wide turn back onto the runway. In the seat opposite Ambra, Robert Langdon closed his eyes for a moment and exhaled. The engines roared outside, and he felt the pressure of acceleration as the jet thundered down the runway. Seconds later, the plane was shooting skyward and banking hard to the southeast, plunging through the night toward Barcelona. CHAPTER 40 rabbi yehuda koves rushed from his study, crossed the garden, and slipped out the front door of his home, descending the steps to the sidewalk. I am no longer safe at home, the rabbi told himself, his heart pounding relentlessly. I must get to the synagogue. The Dohany Street Synagogue was not only Koves's lifelong sanctuary, it was a veritable fortress. The shrine's barricades, barbed fences, and twenty-four-hour guards served as a sharp reminder of Budapest's long history of anti-Semitism. Tonight, Koves felt grateful to hold the keys to such a citadel. The synagogue was fifteen minutes away from his house�a peaceful stroll Koves took every day�and yet tonight, as he started out along Kossuth Lajos Street, he felt only fear. Lowering his head, Koves warily scanned the shadows before him as he began his journey. Almost immediately he saw something that put him on edge. A dark figure sat hunched on a bench across the street�a powerfully built man wearing blue jeans and a baseball cap�poking casually at his smartphone, his bearded face illuminated by the glow of the device. He is not from this neighborhood, Koves knew, increasing his pace. The man in the baseball cap glanced up, watched the rabbi a moment, and then returned to his phone. Koves pressed on. After one block, he glanced nervously behind him. To his dismay, the man in the baseball cap was no longer on the bench. He had crossed the street and was walking along the sidewalk behind Koves. He's following me! The old rabbi's feet moved faster, and his breath grew short. He wondered if leaving his home had been a terrible mistake. Valdespino urged me to stay inside! Whom have I decided to trust? Koves had planned to wait for Valdespino's men to come and escort him to Madrid, but the phone call had changed everything. The dark seeds of doubt were sprouting quickly. The woman on the phone had warned him: The bishop is sending men not to transport you, but rather to remove you�just like he removed Syed al-Fadl. Then she had presented evidence so persuasive that Koves had panicked and fled. Now, as he hurried along the sidewalk, Koves feared he might not reach the safety of his synagogue after all. The man in the baseball cap was still behind him, tailing Koves at about fifty meters. A deafening screech tore through the night air, and Koves jumped. The sound, he realized with relief, was a city bus braking at a bus stop just down the block. Koves felt as if it had been sent by God Himself as he rushed toward the vehicle and scrambled aboard. The bus was packed with raucous college students, and two of them politely made room for Koves in front. "Koszonom," the rabbi wheezed, breathless. Thank you. Before the bus could pull away, however, the man in the jeans and baseball cap sprinted up behind the bus and narrowly managed to climb aboard. Koves went rigid, but the man walked past him without a glance and took a seat in the back. In the reflection of the windshield, the rabbi could see that the man had returned to his smartphone, apparently engrossed in some sort of video game. Don't be paranoid, Yehuda, he chided himself. He has no interest in you. When the bus arrived at the Dohany Street stop, Koves gazed longingly at the spires of the synagogue only a few blocks away, and yet he could not bring himself to leave the safety of the crowded bus. If I get out, and the man follows me ... Koves remained in his seat, deciding he was probably safer in a crowd. I can just ride the bus for a while and catch my breath, he thought, although he now wished he had used the toilet before fleeing his home so abruptly. It was only moments later, as the bus pulled away from Dohany Street, that Rabbi Koves realized the terrible flaw in his plan. It's Saturday night, and the passengers are all kids. Koves now realized that everyone on this bus would almost certainly get off in the exact same place�one stop away, in the heart of Budapest's Jewish quarter. After World War II, this neighborhood had been left in ruins, but the decaying structures were now the hub of one of Europe's most vibrant bar scenes�the famous "ruin bars"�trendy nightclubs housed in dilapidated buildings. On weekends, throngs of students and tourists gathered here to party in the bombed- out skeletons of graffiti-covered warehouses and old mansions, now retooled with the latest sound systems, colorful lighting, and eclectic art. Sure enough, when the bus screeched to its next stop, all of the students piled out together. The man in the cap remained seated in the back, still engrossed in his phone. Instinct told Koves to get out as fast as he could, and so he clambered to his feet, hurried down the aisle, and descended into the crowd of students on the street. The bus revved up to pull away, but then suddenly halted, its door hissing open to release one final passenger�the man in the baseball cap. Koves felt his pulse skyrocket once again, and yet the man did not glance even once at Koves. Instead, he turned his back to the crowd and walked briskly in the other direction, placing a phone call as he went. Stop imagining things, Koves told himself, trying to breathe calmly. The bus departed and the pack of students immediately began moving down the street toward the bars. For safety, Rabbi Koves would stay with them as long as possible, eventually making a sharp left and walking back toward the synagogue. It's only a few blocks, he told himself, ignoring the heaviness of his legs and the increasing pressure in his bladder. The ruin bars were packed, their boisterous clientele spilling out into the streets. All around Koves, the sounds of electronic music throbbed, and the tang of beer permeated the air, mixing with the sweet fumes of Sopianae cigarettes and Kiirtoskalacs chimney cakes. As he neared the corner, Koves still had the eerie sense he was being watched. He slowed down and stole one more glance behind him. Thankfully, the man in the jeans and baseball cap was nowhere to be seen. In a darkened entryway, the crouched silhouette remained motionless for ten long seconds before carefully peering out of the shadows toward the corner. Nice try, old man, he thought, knowing he had ducked out of sight just in time. The man double-checked the syringe in his pocket. Then he stepped from the shadows, adjusted his baseball cap, and hurried after his mark. CHAPTER 41 guardia commander diego Garza sprinted back up toward the residential apartments, still clutching Monica Martin's computer tablet. The tablet contained a recording of a phone call�a conversation between a Hungarian rabbi named Yehuda Koves and some kind of online whistle-blower �and the shocking contents of the recording had left Commander Garza precious few options. Whether or not Valdespino was actually behind the murderous conspiracy alleged by this whistle-blower, Garza knew that when the recording went public, Valdespino's reputation would be forever destroyed. I must warn the prince and insulate him from the fallout. Valdespino must be removed from the palace before this story breaks. In politics, perception was everything�and the information mongers, justly or not, were about to throw Valdespino under the bus. Clearly, the crown prince could not be seen anywhere near the bishop tonight. PR coordinator Monica Martin had strongly advised Garza to have the prince make a statement immediately, or risk looking complicit. She's right, Garza knew. We have to get Julian on television. Now. Garza reached the top of the stairs and moved breathlessly along the corridor toward Julian's apartment, glancing down at the tablet in his hand. In addition to the image of the Francoist tattoo and the recording of the rabbi's phone call, the impending ConspiracyNet data-dump was apparently going to include a third and final revelation�something that Martin warned would be the most inflammatory of all. A data constellation, she had called it�describing what amounted to a collection of seemingly random and disparate data points or factoids that conspiracy theorists were encouraged to analyze and connect in meaningful ways to create possible "constellations." They're no better than Zodiac nuts! he fumed. Fabricating animal shapes out of the random arrangements of stars! Unfortunately, the ConspiracyNet data points that were displayed on the tablet in Garza's hand appeared to have been especially formulated to coalesce into a single constellation, and from the palace's viewpoint, it was not a pretty one. ConspiracyNet.com The Kirsch Assassination What We Know So Far � Edmond Kirsch shared his scientific discovery with three religious leaders�Bishop Antonio Valdespino, Allamah Syed al-Fadl, and Rabbi Yehuda Koves. � Kirsch and al-Fadl are both dead, and Rabbi Yehuda Koves is no longer answering his home phone and appears to have gone missing. � Bishop Valdespino is alive and well, and was last seen walking across the plaza toward the Royal Palace. � Kirsch's assassin�identified as navy admiral Luis Avila�has body markings that tie him to a faction of ultraconservative Francoists. (Is Bishop Valdespino�a known conservative�a Francoist as well?) � And finally, according to sources inside the Guggenheim, the event's guest list was locked, and yet assassin Luis Avila was added at the last minute per the request of someone inside the Royal Palace. (The individual on-site who fulfilled that request was future queen consort Ambra Vidal.) ConspiracyNet would like to acknowledge the substantial ongoing contributions of civilian watchdog monte@iglesia.org on this story. IMonte@iglesia.org? Garza had already decided the e-mail address had to be a fake. Iglesia.org was a prominent evangelical Catholic website in Spain, an online community of priests, laypeople, and students who were devoted to the teachings of Jesus. The informant seemed to have spoofed the domain so that the allegations would appear to come from iglesia.org. Clever, Garza thought, knowing that Bishop Valdespino was deeply admired by the devout Catholics behind the site. Garza wondered if this online "contributor" was the same informant who had called the rabbi. As he reached the apartment door, Garza wondered how he would break the news to the prince. The day had started quite normally, and suddenly it seemed as if the palace was engaged in a war with ghosts. A faceless informant named Monte? An array of data points? Making matters even worse, Garza still had no news on the status of Ambra Vidal and Robert Langdon. God help us if the press learns of Ambra's defiant actions tonight. The commander entered without knocking. "Prince Julian?" he called, hurrying toward the living room. "I need to speak to you alone for a moment." Garza reached the living room and stopped short. The room was empty. "Don Julian?" he called, wheeling back toward the kitchen. "Bishop Valdespino?" Garza searched the entire apartment, but the prince and Valdespino were gone. He immediately called the prince's cell phone and was startled to hear a telephone ringing. The sound was faint but audible, somewhere in the apartment. Garza called the prince again, and listened for the muffled ringing, this time tracking the sound to a small painting on the wall, which he knew concealed the apartment's wall safe. Julian locked his phone in the safe? It was beyond belief to Garza that the prince would abandon his phone on a night when communication was so critical. And where did they go? Garza now tried Valdespino's cell number, hoping the bishop would answer. To his utter astonishment, a second muffled ringtone sounded inside the vault. Valdespino abandoned his phone as well? With rising panic, a wild-eyed Garza dashed out of the apartment. For the next several minutes, he ran down hallways shouting, searching both upstairs and downstairs. They can't have evaporated into thin air! When Garza finally stopped running, he found himself standing breathless at the base of Sabatini's elegant grand staircase. He lowered his head in defeat. The tablet in his hands was asleep now, but in the blackened screen, he could see the reflection of the ceiling fresco directly overhead. The irony felt cruel. The fresco was Giaquinto's grand masterpiece� Religion Protected by Spain. CHAPTER 42 as the gulfstream G550 jet climbed to cruising altitude, Robert Langdon stared blankly out the oval window and tried to gather his thoughts. The past two hours had been a whirlwind of emotions�from the thrill of watching Edmond's presentation begin to unfold to the gut-wrenching horror of seeing his grisly murder. And the mystery of Edmond's presentation seemed only to deepen the more Langdon considered it. What secret had Edmond unveiled? Where do we come from? Where are we going? Edmond's words in the spiral sculpture earlier tonight replayed in Langdon's mind: Robert, the discovery I've made ... it very clearly answers both of these questions. Edmond had claimed to have solved two of life's greatest mysteries, and yet, Langdon wondered, how could Edmond's news have been so dangerously disruptive that someone would have murdered him to keep it silent? All Langdon knew for sure was that Edmond was referring to human origin and human destiny. What shocking origin did Edmond uncover? What mysterious destiny? Edmond had appeared optimistic and upbeat about the future, so it seemed unlikely that his prediction was something apocalyptic. Then what could Edmond possibly have predicted that would concern the clerics so deeply? "Robert?" Ambra materialized next to him with a hot cup of coffee. "You said black?" "Perfect, yes, thank you." Langdon gratefully accepted the mug, hoping some caffeine might help unknot his tangled thoughts. Ambra took a seat opposite him and poured herself a glass of red wine from an elegantly embossed bottle. "Edmond carries a stash of Chateau Montrose aboard. Seems a pity to waste it." Langdon had tasted Montrose only once, in an ancient secret wine cellar beneath Trinity College Dublin, while he was there researching the illuminated manuscript known as The Book of Kells. Ambra cradled her wine goblet in two hands, and as she brought it to her lips, she gazed up at Langdon over the rim. Once again, he found himself strangely disarmed by the woman's natural elegance. "I've been thinking," she said. "You mentioned earlier that Edmond was in Boston and asked you about various Creation stories?" "Yes, about a year ago. He was interested in the different ways that major religions answered the question �Where do we come from?"' "So, maybe that's a good place for us to start?" she said. "Maybe we can unravel what he was working on?" "I'm all for starting at the beginning," Langdon replied, "but I'm not sure what there is to unravel. There are only two schools of thought on where we came from�the religious notion that God created humans fully formed, and the Darwinian model in which we crawled out of the primordial ooze and eventually evolved into humans." "So what if Edmond discovered a third possibility?" Ambra asked, her brown eyes flashing. "What if that's part of his discovery? What if he has proven that the human species came neither from Adam and Eve nor from Darwinian evolution?" Langdon had to admit that such a discovery�an alternative story of human origin�would be earth-shattering, but he simply could not imagine what it might be. "Darwin's theory of evolution is extremely well established," he said, "because it is based on scientifically observable fact, and clearly illustrates how organisms evolve and adapt to their environments over time. The theory of evolution is universally accepted by the sharpest minds in science." "Is it?" Ambra said. "I've seen books that argue Darwin was entirely wrong." "What she says is true," Winston chimed in from the phone, which was recharging on the table between them. "More than fifty titles were published over the past two decades alone." Langdon had forgotten Winston was still with them. "Some of these books were bestsellers," Winston added. "What Darwin Got Wrong ... Defeating Darwinism ... Darwin's Black Box ... Darwin on Trial ... The Dark Side of Charles Dar �" "Yes," Langdon interrupted, fully aware of the substantial collection of books claiming to disprove Darwin. "I actually read two of them a while back." "And?" Ambra pressed. Langdon smiled politely. "Well, I can't speak for all of them, but the two I read argued from a fundamentally Christian viewpoint. One went so far as to suggest that the earth's fossil record was placed there by God �in order to test our faith.'" Ambra frowned. "Okay, so they didn't sway your thinking." "No, but they made me curious, and so I asked a Harvard biology professor for his opinion of the books." Langdon smiled. "The professor, by the way, happened to be the late Stephen J. Gould." "Why do I know that name?" Ambra asked. "Stephen J. Gould," Winston said at once. "Renowned evolutionary biologist and paleontologist. His theory of 'punctuated equilibrium' explained some of the gaps in the fossil record and helped support Darwin's model of evolution." "Gould just chuckled," Langdon said, "and told me that most of the anti- Darwin books were published by the likes of the Institute for Creation Research �an organization that, according to its own informational materials, views the Bible as an infallible literal account of historical and scientific fact." "Meaning," Winston said, "they believe that Burning Bushes can speak, that Noah fit every living species onto a single boat, and that people turn into pillars of salt. Not the firmest of footings for a scientific research company." "True," Langdon said, "and yet there are some nonreligious books that attempt to discredit Darwin from a historical standpoint�accusing him of stealing his theory from the French naturalist Jean-Baptiste Lamarck, who first proposed that organisms transformed themselves in response to their environment." "That line of thought is irrelevant, Professor," Winston said. "Whether or not Darwin was guilty of plagiarism has no bearing on the veracity of his evolutionary theory." "I can't argue with that," Ambra said. "And so, Robert, I assume if you asked Professor Gould, 'Where do we come from?' he would reply, without a doubt, that we evolved from apes." Langdon nodded. "I'm paraphrasing here, but Gould essentially assured me that there was no question whatsoever among real scientists that evolution is happening. Empirically, we can observe the process. The better questions, he believed, were: Why is evolution happening? And how did it all start?" "Did he offer any answers?" Ambra said. "None that I could understand, but he did illustrate his point with a thought experiment. It's called the Infinite Hallway." Langdon paused, taking another sip of coffee. "Yes, a helpful illustration," Winston chimed in before Langdon could speak. "It goes like this: imagine yourself walking down a long hallway�a corridor so long that it's impossible to see where you came from or where you're going." Langdon nodded, impressed by the breadth of Winston's knowledge. "Then, behind you in the distance," Winston continued, "you hear the sound of a bouncing ball. Sure enough, when you turn, you see a ball bouncing toward you. It is bouncing closer and closer, until it finally bounces past you, and just keeps going, bouncing into the distance and out of sight." "Correct," Langdon said. "The question is not: Is the ball bouncing? Because clearly, the ball is bouncing. We can observe it. The question is: Why is it bouncing? How did it start bouncing? Did someone kick it? Is it a special ball that simply enjoys bouncing? Are the laws of physics in this hallway such that the ball has no choice but to bounce forever?" "Gould's point being," Winston concluded, "that just as with evolution, we cannot see far enough into the past to know how the process began." "Exactly," Langdon said. "All we can do is observe that it is happening." "This was similar, of course," Winston said, "to the challenge of understanding the Big Bang. Cosmologists have devised elegant formulas to describe the expanding universe for any given Time��T'�in the past or future. However, when they try to look back to the instant when the Big Bang occurred �where T equals zero�the mathematics all goes mad, describing what seems to be a mystical speck of infinite heat and infinite density." Langdon and Ambra looked at each other, impressed. "Correct again," Langdon said. "And because the human mind is not equipped to handle �infinity' very well, most scientists now discuss the universe only in terms of moments after the Big Bang�where T is greater than zero�which ensures that the mathematical does not turn mystical" One of Langdon's Harvard colleagues�a solemn physics professor�had become so fed up with philosophy majors attending his Origins of the Universe seminar that he finally posted a sign on his classroom door. In my classroom, T > 0. For all inquiries where T = 0, please visit the Religion Department. "How about Panspermia?" Winston asked. "The notion that life on earth was seeded from another planet by a meteor or cosmic dust? Panspermia is considered a scientifically valid possibility to explain the existence of life on earth." "Even if it's true," Langdon offered, "it doesn't answer how life first began in the universe. We're just kicking the can down the road, ignoring the origin of the bouncing ball and postponing the big question: Where does life come from?" Winston fell silent. Ambra sipped her wine, looking amused by their interplay. As the Gulfstream G550 reached altitude and leveled off, Langdon found himself imagining what it would mean to the world if Edmond truly had found the answer to the age-old question: Where do we come from? And yet, according to Edmond, that answer was only part of the secret. Whatever the tmth might be, Edmond had protected the details of his discovery with a formidable password�a single, forty-seven-letter line of poetry. If all went according to plan, Langdon and Ambra would soon uncover it inside Edmond's home in Barcelona. CHAPTER 43 nearly A decade after its inception, the "dark web" remains a mystery to the vast majority of online users. Inaccessible via traditional search engines, this sinister shadowland of the World Wide Web provides anonymous access to a mind-boggling menu of illegal goods and services. From its humble beginning hosting Silk Road�the first online black market to sell illegal drugs�the dark web blossomed into a massive network of illicit sites dealing in weapons, child pornography, political secrets, and even professionals for hire, including prostitutes, hackers, spies, terrorists, and assassins. Every week, the dark web hosted literally millions of transactions, and tonight, outside the ruin bars of Budapest, one of those transactions was about to be completed. The man in the baseball cap and blue jeans moved stealthily along Kazinczy Street, staying in the shadows as he tracked his prey. Missions like this one had become his bread and butter over the past few years and were always negotiated through a handful of popular networks�Unfriendly Solution, Hitman Network, and BesaMafia. Assassination for hire was a billion-dollar industry and growing daily, due primarily to the dark web's guarantee of anonymous negotiations and untraceable payment via Bitcoin. Most hits involved insurance fraud, bad business partnerships, or turbulent marriages, but the rationale was never the concern of the person carrying out the job. No questions, the killer mused. That is the unspoken rule that makes my business work. Tonight's job was one he had accepted several days ago. His anonymous employer had offered him 150,000 euros for staking out the home of an old rabbi and remaining "on call" in case action needed to be taken. Action, in this case, meant breaking into the man's home and injecting him with potassium chloride, resulting in immediate death from an apparent heart attack. Tonight, unexpectedly, the rabbi had left his home in the middle of the night and taken a city bus to a seedy neighborhood. The assassin had tailed him and then used the encrypted overlay program on his smart-phone to inform his employer of the development. Target has exited home. Traveled to bar district. Possibly meeting someone? His employer's response was almost immediate. Execute. Now, among the min bars and dark alleyways, what had begun as a stakeout had become a deadly game of cat and mouse. Rabbi Yehuda Koves was sweating and out of breath as he made his way along Kazinczy Street. His lungs burned, and he felt as if his aging bladder were about to burst. All I need is a toilet and some rest, he thought, pausing among a crowd congregating outside Bar Szimpla�one of Budapest's largest and most famous min bars. The patrons here were such a diverse mix of ages and professions that nobody gave the old rabbi a second look. I'll stop just for a moment, he decided, moving toward the bar. Once a spectacular stone mansion with elegant balconies and tall windows, the Bar Szimpla was now a dilapidated shell covered with graffiti. As Koves moved through the wide portico of this once grand city residence, he passed through a doorway inscribed with an encoded message: Egg-esh-Ay-ged-reh! It took him a moment to realize that it was nothing but the phonetic spelling of the Hungarian word egeszsegedre �meaning "cheers!" Entering, Koves stared in disbelief at the bar's cavernous interior. The derelict mansion was built around a sprawling courtyard dotted with some of the strangest objects the rabbi had ever seen�a couch made from a bathtub, mannequins riding bicycles suspended in the air, and a gutted East German Trabant sedan, which now served as makeshift seating for patrons. The courtyard was enclosed by high walls adorned with a patchwork of spray- painted graffiti, Soviet-era posters, classical sculptures, and hanging plants that spilled over interior balconies packed with patrons who all swayed to the thumping music. The air smelled of cigarettes and beer. Young couples kissed passionately in plain sight while others discreetly smoked from small pipes and drank shots of palinka, a popular fruit brandy bottled in Hungary. Koves always found it ironic that humans, despite being God's most sublime creation, were still just animals at the core, their behavior driven to a great extent by a quest for creature comforts. We comfort our physical bodies in hopes our souls will follow. Koves spent much of his time counseling those who overindulged in the animal temptations of the body�primarily food and sex� and with the rise of Internet addiction and cheap designer drugs, his job had grown more challenging every day. The only creature comfort Koves needed at the moment was a restroom, and so he was dismayed to find a line ten people deep. Unable to wait, he gingerly climbed the stairs, where he was told he would find numerous other restrooms. On the second floor of the mansion, the rabbi moved through a labyrinth of adjoining sitting rooms and bedrooms, each with its own little bar or seating area. He asked one of the bartenders about a bathroom, and the man pointed to a hallway a good distance away, apparently accessible along a balcony walkway that overlooked the courtyard. Koves quickly made his way to the balcony, placing a steadying hand on the railing as he moved along it. As he walked, he peered absently into the bustling courtyard below, where a sea of young people gyrated in rhythm to the deep pulse of the music. Then Koves saw it. He stopped short, his blood turning cold. There, in the middle of the crowd, the man in the baseball cap and jeans was staring directly up at him. For one brief instant, the two men locked eyes. Then, with the speed of a panther, the man in the cap sprang into action, pushing his way past patrons and sprinting up the staircase. The assassin bounded up the stairs, scrutinizing every face he passed. Bar Szimpla was quite familiar to him, and he quickly made his way to the balcony where his target had been standing. The rabbi was gone. I did not pass you, the killer thought, which means you moved deeper into the building. Raising his gaze to a darkened corridor ahead, the assassin smiled, suspecting he knew precisely where his mark would try to hide. The corridor was cramped and smelled of urine. At the far end was a warped wooden door. The killer padded loudly down the corridor and banged on the door. Silence. He knocked again. A deep voice inside grunted that the room was occupied. "Bocsasson meg!" the killer apologized in a chirpy voice, and made a show of loudly moving away. Then he silently turned around and came back to the door, pressing his ear to the wood. Inside, he could hear the rabbi whispering desperately in Hungarian. "Someone is trying to kill me! He was outside my house! Now he has trapped me inside Bar Szimpla in Budapest! Please! Send help!" Apparently, his target had dialed 112�Budapest's equivalent of 911. Response times were notoriously slow, but nonetheless, the killer had heard enough. Glancing behind him to make sure he was alone, he leveled his muscular shoulder toward the door, leaned back, and synchronized his attack with the thunderous beat of the music. The old butterfly latch exploded on the first try. The door flew open. The killer stepped inside, closed the door behind him, and faced his prey. The man cowering in the corner looked as confused as he did terrified. The killer took the rabbi's phone, ended the call, and tossed the phone into the toilet. "Wh-who sent you?!" the rabbi stammered. "The beauty of my situation," the man replied, "is that I have no way to know." The old man was wheezing now, sweating profusely. He suddenly began to gasp, his eyes bulging out as he reached up and seized his own chest with both hands. Really? the killer thought, smiling. He's having a heart attack? On the bathroom floor, the old man writhed and choked, his eyes pleading for compassion as his face turned red and he clawed at his chest. Finally, he pitched face-first onto the grimy tile, where he lay trembling and shuddering as his bladder emptied itself into his pants, a trickle of urine now running across the floor. Finally, the rabbi was still. The killer crouched down and listened for breathing. Not a sound. Then he stood up, smirking. "You made my job far easier than I anticipated." With that, the killer strode toward the door. Rabbi Koves's lungs strained for air. He had just given the performance of a lifetime. Teetering near unconsciousness, he lay motionless and listened as his attacker's footsteps retreated across the bathroom floor. The door creaked open and then clicked closed. Silence. Koves forced himself to wait another couple of seconds to ensure that his attacker had walked down the hall out of earshot. Then, unable to wait another instant, Koves exhaled and began pulling in deep life-giving breaths. Even the stale air of the bathroom tasted heaven-sent. Slowly, he opened his eyes, his vision hazy from lack of oxygen. As Koves raised his throbbing head, his vision began to clear. To his bewilderment, he saw a dark figure standing just inside the closed door. The man in the baseball cap was smiling down at him. Koves froze. He never left the room. The killer took two long strides to the rabbi, and with a viselike grip, he grabbed the rabbi's neck and shoved his face back into the tile floor. "You could stop your breathing," snarled the killer, "but you couldn't stop your heart." He laughed. "Not to worry, I can help you with that." An instant later, a searing point of heat tore into the side of Koves's neck. A molten fire seemed to flow down his throat and up over his skull. This time, when his heart seized, he knew it was for real. After dedicating much of his life to the mysteries of Shamayim �the dwelling place of God and the righteous dead�Rabbi Yehuda Koves knew that all the answers were just a heartbeat away. CHAPTER 44 alone in the spacious restroom of the G550 jet, Ambra Vidal stood at the sink and let warm water run gently over her hands as she stared into the mirror, barely recognizing herself in the reflection. What have I done? She took another sip of wine, longing for her old life of only a few months ago�anonymous, single, engrossed in her museum work�but all of that was gone now. It had evaporated the moment Julian proposed. No, she chided herself. It evaporated the moment you said yes. The horror of tonight's assassination had settled in her gut, and now her logical mind was fearfully weighing the implications. I invited Edmond's assassin to the museum. I was tricked by someone in the palace. And now I know too much. There was no proof that Prince Julian was behind the bloody killing, nor that he was even aware of the assassination plan. Even so, Ambra had seen enough of the palace's inner workings to suspect that none of this could have happened without the prince's knowledge, if not his blessing. I told Julian too much. In recent weeks, Ambra had felt the growing need to justify every second she spent away from her jealous fiance, and so she had privately shared with Julian much of what she knew about Edmond's upcoming presentation. Ambra now feared her openness might have been reckless. Ambra turned off the water and dried her hands, reaching for her wine goblet and draining the last few drops. In the mirror before her she saw a stranger�a once confident professional who was now filled with regret and shame. The mistakes I've made in a few short months ... As her mind reeled back in time, she wondered what she could possibly have done differently. Four months ago, on a rainy night in Madrid, Ambra was attending a fund-raiser at the Reina Sofia Museum of Modern Art... Most of the guests had migrated to room 206.06 to view the museum's most famous work� El Guernica �a sprawling twenty-five-foot-long Picasso that evoked the horrific bombing of a small Basque town during the Spanish Civil War. Ambra, however, found the painting too painful to view�a vivid reminder of the brutal oppression endured under Spain's fascistic dictator General Francisco Franco between 1939 and 1975. Instead, she had chosen to slip alone into a quiet gallery to enjoy the work of one of her favorite Spanish artists, Maruja Mallo, a female Surrealist from Galicia whose success in the 1930s had helped shatter the glass ceiling for female artists in Spain. Ambra was standing alone admiring La Verbena �a political satire filled with complex symbols�when a deep voice spoke behind her. "Es casi tan guapa como tu," the man declared. It's almost as beautiful as you are. Seriously? Ambra stared straight ahead and resisted the urge to roll her eyes. At events like these, the museum sometimes felt more like an awkward pickup bar than a cultural center. "iQue crees que significa?" the voice behind her pressed. What do you think it means ? "I have no idea," she lied, hoping that speaking English might make the man move on. "I just like it." "I like it too," the man replied in almost accentless English. "Mallo was ahead of her time. Sadly, for the untrained eye, this painting's superficial beauty can camouflage the deeper substance within." He paused. "I imagine a woman like you must face that problem all the time." Ambra groaned. Do lines like this really work on women? Affixing a polite smile to her face, she spun around to dispatch the man. "Sir, that's very kind of you to say, but�" Ambra Vidal froze midsentence. The man facing her was someone she had seen on television and in magazines for her entire life. "Oh," Ambra stammered. "You're ..." "Presumptuous?" the handsome man ventured. "Clumsily bold? I'm sorry, I live a sheltered life, and I'm not very good at this sort of thing." He smiled and extended a polite hand. "My name is Julian." "I think I know your name," Ambra told him, blushing as she shook hands with Prince Julian, the future king of Spain. He was far taller than she had imagined, with soft eyes and a confident smile. "I didn't know you were going to be here tonight," she continued, quickly regaining her composure. "I imagined you as more of a Prado man�you know, Goya, Velazquez ... the classics." "You mean conservative and old-fashioned?" He laughed warmly. "I think you have me confused with my father. Mallo and Miro have always been favorites of mine." Ambra and the prince talked for several minutes, and she was impressed by his knowledge of art. Then again, the man grew up in Madrid's Royal Palace, which possessed one of Spain's finest collections; he'd probably had an original El Greco hanging in his nursery. "I realize this will seem forward," the prince said, presenting her with a gold- embossed business card, "but I would love for you to join me at a dinner party tomorrow night. My direct number is on the card. Just let me know." "Dinner?" Ambra joked. "You don't even know my name." "Ambra Vidal," he replied matter-of-factly. "You're thirty-nine years old. You hold a degree in art history from the Universidad de Salamanca. You're the director of our Guggenheim Museum in Bilbao. You recently spoke out on the controversy surrounding Luis Quiles, whose artwork, I agree, graphically mirrors the horrors of modern life and may not be appropriate for young children, but I'm not sure I agree with you that his work resembles that of Banksy. You've never been married. You have no children. And you look fantastic in black." Ambra's jaw dropped. "My goodness. Does this approach really work?" "I have no idea," he said with a smile. "I guess we'll find out." As if on cue, two Guardia Real agents materialized and ushered the prince off to mingle with some VIPs. Ambra clutched the business card in her hand and felt something she had not felt in years. Butterflies. Did a prince just ask me for a date? Ambra had been a gangly teenager, and the boys who asked her out had always felt themselves to be on an equal footing with her. Later in life, though, when her beauty had blossomed, Ambra suddenly found men to be intimidated in her presence, fumbling and self-conscious and entirely too deferential. Tonight, however, a powerful man had boldly strode up to her and taken total control. It made her feel feminine. And young. The very next night, a driver collected Ambra at her hotel and took her to the Royal Palace, where she found herself seated next to the prince in the company of two dozen other guests, many of whom she recognized from the society pages or politics. The prince introduced her as his "lovely new friend" and deftly launched a conversation about art in which Ambra could participate fully. She had the sensation that she was being auditioned somehow, but strangely, she didn't really mind. She felt flattered. At the evening's end, Julian took her aside and whispered, "I hope you had fun. I'd love to see you again." He smiled. "How about Thursday night?" "Thank you," Ambra replied, "but I'm afraid I'm flying back to Bilbao in the morning." "Then I'll fly up as well," he said. "Have you been to the restaurant Etxanobe?" Ambra had to laugh. Etxanobe was one of Bilbao's most coveted dining experiences. A favorite of art aficionados from around the world, the restaurant boasted an avant-garde decor and colorful cuisine that made diners feel as if they were seated in a landscape painted by Marc Chagall. "That would be lovely," she heard herself say. At Etxanobe, over stylishy presented plates of sumac-seared tuna and truffled asparagus, Julian opened up about the political challenges he faced as he attempted to emerge from the shadow of his ailing father, and also about the personal pressure he felt to continue the royal line. Ambra recognized in him the innocence of a cloistered little boy but also saw the makings of a leader with a fervent passion for his country. She found it an alluring combination. That night, when Julian's security guards whisked him back to his private plane, Ambra knew she was smitten. You barely know him, she reminded herself. Take it slow. The next several months seemed to pass in an instant as Ambra and Julian saw each other constantly�dinners at the palace, picnics on the grounds of his country estate, even a movie matinee. Their rapport was unforced, and Ambra couldn't remember ever being happier. Julian was endearingly old-fashioned, often holding her hand or stealing a polite kiss, but never crossing the conventional boundaries, and Ambra appreciated his fine manners. One sunny morning, three weeks ago, Ambra was in Madrid, where she was scheduled to appear in a segment of a morning TV show about the Guggenheim's upcoming exhibits. RTVE's Telediario was watched by millions live around the country, and Ambra was a little apprehensive about doing live television, but she knew the spot would provide superb national coverage for the museum. The night before the show, she and Julian met for a deliciously casual dinner at Trattoria Malatesta and then slipped quietly through El Parque del Retiro. Watching the families out strolling and the scores of children laughing and running about, Ambra felt totally at peace, lost in the moment. "Do you like children?" Julian asked. "I adore them," she replied honestly. "In fact, sometimes I feel like children are the only thing missing in my life." Julian smiled broadly. "I know the feeling." In that instant, the way he looked at her felt different somehow, and Ambra suddenly realized why Julian was asking the question. A surge of fear gripped her, and a voice in her head screamed out, Tell him! TELL HIM NOW! She tried to speak, but she couldn't make a sound. "Are you okay?" he asked, looking concerned. Ambra smiled. "It's the Telediario show. I'm just a little nervous." "Exhale. You'll be great." Julian flashed her a broad smile and then leaned forward and gave her a quick soft kiss on the lips. The next morning, at seven thirty, Ambra found herself on a television soundstage, engaged in a surprisingly comfortable on-air chat with the three charming Telediario hosts. She was so caught up in her enthusiasm for the Guggenheim that she barely noticed the television cameras and the live studio audience, or remembered that five million people were watching at home. "Gracias, Ambra, y muy interesante," said the female host as the segment concluded. "Un gran placer conocerte." Ambra nodded her thanks and waited for the interview to end. Strangely, the female host gave her a coy smile and continued the segment by turning to address the home audience directly. "This morning," she began in Spanish, "a very special guest has made a surprise visit to the Telediario studio, and we'd like to bring him out." All three hosts stood up, clapping as a tall, elegant man strode onto the set. When the audience saw him, they jumped to their feet, cheering wildly. Ambra stood too, staring in shock. Julian? Prince Julian waved to the crowd and politely shook the hands of the three hosts. Then he walked over and stood beside Ambra, placing an arm around her. "My father has always been a romantic," he said, speaking Spanish and looking directly into the camera to address the viewers. "When my mother died, he never stopped loving her. I inherited his romanticism, and I believe when a man finds love, he knows in an instant." He looked at Ambra and smiled warmly. "And so ..." Julian stepped back and faced her. When Ambra realized what was about to happen, she felt paralyzed with disbelief. NO! Julian! What are you doing? Without warning, the crown prince of Spain was suddenly kneeling down before her. "Ambra Vidal, I am asking you not as a prince, but simply as a man in love." He looked up at her with misty eyes, and the cameras wheeled around to get a close-up of his face. "I love you. Will you marry me?" The audience and the show's hosts all gasped in joy, and Ambra could feel millions of eyes around the country focusing intently on her. Blood rushed to her face, and the lights felt suddenly scalding hot on her skin. Her heart began to pound wildly as she stared down at Julian, a thousand thoughts racing through her head. How could you put me in this position?! We've only recently met! There are things I haven't told you about myself... things that could change everything! Ambra had no idea how long she had stood in silent panic, but finally one of the hosts gave an awkward laugh and said, "I believe Ms. Vidal is in a trance! Ms. Vidal? A handsome prince is kneeling before you and professing his love before the entire world!" Ambra searched her mind for some graceful way out. All she heard was silence, and she knew she was trapped. There was only one way this public moment could end. "I'm hesitating because I can't believe this fairy tale has a happy ending." She relaxed her shoulders and smiled warmly down at Julian. "Of course I will marry you, Prince Julian." The studio erupted in wild applause. Julian stood up and took Ambra in his arms. As they embraced, she realized that they had never shared a long hug before this moment. Ten minutes later, the two were sitting in the back of his limousine. "I can see I startled you," Julian said. "I'm sorry. I was trying to be romantic. I have strong feelings for you, and�" "Julian," Ambra interrupted forcefully, "I have strong feelings for you too, but you put me in an impossible position back there! I never imagined you would propose so quickly! You and I barely know each other. There are so many things I need to tell you�important things about my past." "Nothing in your past matters." "This might matter. A lot." He smiled and shook his head. "I love you. It won't matter. Try me." Ambra studied the man before her. Okay, then. This was most certainly not how she had wanted this conversation to go, but he had given her no choice. "Well, here it is, Julian. When I was a little girl, I had a terrible infection that almost killed me." "Okay." As Ambra spoke, she felt a deep emptiness welling up inside her. "And the result was that my life's dream of having children ... well, it can only be a dream." "I don't understand." "Julian," she said flatly. "I can't have children. My childhood health problems left me infertile. I've always wanted children, but I am unable to have any of my own. I'm sorry. I know how important that is to you, but you've just proposed to a woman who cannot give you an heir." Julian went white. Ambra locked eyes with him, willing him to speak. Julian, this is the moment when you hold me close and tell me everything's okay. This is the moment you tell me it doesn't matter, and that you love me anyway. And then it happened. Julian shifted away from her ever so slightly. In that instant, Ambra knew it was over. CHAPTER 45 the guardia'S division of electronic security is located in a windowless warren of rooms on the subterranean level of the Royal Palace. Intentionally isolated from the palace's vast Guardia barracks and armory, the division's headquarters consists of a dozen computer cubicles, one telephone switchboard, and a wall of security monitors. The eight-person staff�all under the age of thirty-five�is responsible for providing secure communication networks for the staff of the Royal Palace and the Guardia Real, as well as handling electronic surveillance support for the physical palace itself. Tonight, as always, the basement suite of rooms was stuffy, reeking of microwaved noodles and popcorn. The fluorescent lights hummed loudly. This is where I asked them to put my office, Martin thought. Although "public relations coordinator" was technically not a Guardia post, Martin's job required access to powerful computers and a tech-sawy staff; thus, the division of electronic security had seemed a far more logical home for her than an underequipped office upstairs. Tonight, Martin thought, I will need every bit of technology available. For the past few months, her primary focus had been to help the palace stay on message during the gradual transfer of power to Prince Julian. It had not been easy. The transition between leaders had provided an opportunity for protesters to speak out against the monarchy. According to the Spanish constitution, the monarchy stood as "a symbol of Spain's enduring unity and permanence." But Martin knew there had been nothing unified about Spain for some time now. In 1931, the Second Republic had marked the end of the monarchy, and then the putsch of General Franco in 1936 had plunged the country into civil war. Today, although the reinstated monarchy was considered a liberal democracy, many liberals continued to denounce the king as an outdated vestige of an oppressive religio-military past, as well as a daily reminder that Spain still had a way to go before it could fully join the modern world. Monica Martin's messaging this month had included the usual portrayals of the king as a beloved symbol who held no real power. Of course, it was a tough sell when the sovereign was commander in chief of the armed forces as well as head of state. Head of state, Martin mused, in a country where separation between church and state has always been controversial. The ailing king's close relationship with Bishop Valdespino had been a thorn in the side of secularists and liberals for many years. And then there is Prince Julian, she thought. Martin knew she owed her job to the prince, but he certainly had been making that job more difficult recently. A few weeks ago, the prince had made the worst PR blunder Martin had ever witnessed. On national television, Prince Julian had gotten down on his knees and made a ludicrous proposal to Ambra Vidal. The excruciating moment could not have been any more awkward unless Ambra had declined to marry him, which, fortunately, she had the good sense not to do. Unfortunately, in the aftermath, Ambra Vidal had revealed herself to be more of a handful than Julian had anticipated, and the fallout from her extracurricular behavior this month had become one of Martin's primary PR concerns. Tonight, however, Ambra's indiscretions seemed all but forgotten. The tidal wave of media activity generated by the events in Bilbao had swelled to an unprecedented magnitude. In the past hour, a viral proliferation of conspiracy theories had taken the world by storm, including several new hypotheses involving Bishop Valdespino. The most significant development concerned the Guggenheim assassin, who had been given access to Kirsch's event "on orders of someone inside the Royal Palace." This damning bit of news had unleashed a deluge of conspiracy theories accusing the bedridden king and Bishop Valdespino of conspiring to murder Edmond Kirsch�a virtual demigod in the digital world, and a beloved American hero who had chosen to live in Spain. This is going to destroy Valdespino, Martin thought. "Everyone, listen up!" Garza now shouted as he strode into the control room. "Prince Julian and Bishop Valdespino are together somewhere on the premises! Check all security feeds and find them. Now!" The commander stalked into Martin's office and quietly updated her on the situation with the prince and the bishop. "Gone?" she said, incredulous. "And they left their phones in the prince's safe?" Garza shrugged. "Apparently so we can't track them." "Well, we'd better find them," Martin declared. "Prince Julian needs to make a statement right now, and he needs to distance himself from Valdespino as much as possible." She relayed all the latest developments. Now it was Garza's turn to look incredulous. "It's all hearsay. There's no way Valdespino could be behind an assassination." "Maybe not, but the killing seems to be tied to the Catholic Church. Someone just found a direct connection between the shooter and a highly placed church official. Have a look." Martin pulled up the latest ConspiracyNet update, which was once again credited to the whistle-blower called monte@iglesia.org. "This went live a few minutes ago." Garza crouched down and began reading the update. "The pope!" he protested. "Avila has a personal connection with�" "Keep reading." When Garza finished, he stepped back from the screen and blinked his eyes repeatedly, as if trying to wake himself from a bad dream. At that moment, a male voice called from the control room. "Commander Garza? I've located them!" Garza and Martin hurried over to the cubicle of Agent Suresh Bhalla, an Indian-born surveillance specialist who pointed to the security feed on his monitor, on which two forms were visible�one in flowing bishop's robes and the other in a formal suit. They appeared to be walking on a wooded path. "East garden," Suresh said. "Two minutes ago." "They've exited the building?!" Garza demanded. "Hold on, sir." Suresh fast-forwarded the footage, managing to follow the bishop and the prince on various cameras located at intervals across the palace complex as the two men left the garden and moved through an enclosed courtyard. "Where are they going?!" Martin had a good idea where they were going, and she noted that Valdespino had taken a shrewd circuitous route that kept them out of sight of the media trucks on the main plaza. As she anticipated, Valdespino and Julian arrived at the southern service entrance of Almudena Cathedral, where the bishop unlocked the door and ushered Prince Julian inside. The door swung shut, and the two men were gone. Garza stared mutely at the screen, clearly struggling to make sense of what he had just seen. "Keep me posted," he finally said, and motioned Martin aside. Once they were out of earshot, Garza whispered, "I have no idea how Bishop Valdespino persuaded Prince Julian to follow him out of the palace, or to leave his phone behind, but clearly the prince has no idea about these accusations against Valdespino, or he would know to distance himself." "I agree," Martin said. "And I'd hate to speculate as to what the bishop's endgame might be, but..." She stopped. "But what?" Garza demanded. Martin sighed. "It appears Valdespino may have just taken an extremely valuable hostage." Some 250 miles to the north, inside the atrium of the Guggenheim Museum, Agent Fonseca's phone began buzzing. It was the sixth time in twenty minutes. When he glanced down at the caller ID, he felt his body snap to attention. "lSi ?" he answered, his heart pounding. The voice on the line spoke in Spanish, slowly and deliberately. "Agent Fonseca, as you are well aware, Spain's future queen consort has made some terrible missteps this evening, associating herself with the wrong people and causing significant embarrassment to the Royal Palace. In order that no further damage be done, it is crucial that you get her back to the palace as quickly as possible." "I'm afraid Ms. Vidal's location is unknown at the moment." "Forty minutes ago, Edmond Kirsch's jet took off from Bilbao Airport� headed for Barcelona," the voice asserted. "I believe Ms. Vidal was on that plane." "How would you know that?" Fonseca blurted, and then instantly regretted his impertinent tone. "If you were doing your job," the voice replied sharply, "you would know too. I want you and your partner to pursue her at once. A military transport is fueling at Bilbao Airport for you right now." "If Ms. Vidal is on that jet," Fonseca said, "she is probably traveling with the American professor Robert Langdon." "Yes," the caller said angrily. "I have no idea how this man persuaded Ms. Vidal to abandon her security and run off with him, but Mr. Langdon is clearly a liability. Your mission is to find Ms. Vidal and bring her back, by force if necessary." "And if Langdon interferes?" There was a heavy silence. "Do your best to limit collateral damage," the caller replied, "but this crisis is severe enough that Professor Langdon would be an acceptable casualty." CHAPTER 46 ConspiracyNet.com BREAKING NEWS KIRSCH COVERAGE GOES MAINSTREAM! Edmond Kirsch's scientific announcement tonight began as an online presentation that attracted a staggering three million online viewers. In the wake of his assassination, however, the Kirsch story is now being covered on mainstream networks live around the world, with current viewership estimated at over eighty million. CHAPTER 47 as kirsch'S gulfstream G550 began its descent into Barcelona, Robert Langdon drained his second mug of coffee and gazed down at the remains of the impromptu late-night snack that he and Ambra had just shared from Edmond's galley�nuts, rice cakes, and assorted "vegan bars" that all tasted the same to him. Across the table, Ambra had just finished her second glass of red wine and was looking much more relaxed. "Thanks for listening," she said, sounding sheepish. "Obviously, I haven't been able to talk about Julian with anyone." Langdon gave her an understanding nod, having just heard the story of Julian's awkward proposal to her on television. She didn't have a choice, Langdon agreed, knowing full well that Ambra could not risk shaming the future king of Spain on national television. "Obviously, if I'd known he was going to propose so quickly," Ambra said, "I would have told him I can't have children. But it all happened without warning." She shook her head and looked sadly out the window. "I thought I liked him. I don't know, maybe it was just the thrill of�" "A tall, dark, handsome prince?" Langdon ventured with a lopsided grin. Ambra laughed quietly and turned back to him. "He did have that going for him. I don't know, he seemed like a good man. Sheltered maybe, but a romantic �not the kind of man who would ever be involved in killing Edmond." Langdon suspected she was right. The prince had little to gain from Edmond's death, and there was no solid evidence to suggest that the prince was involved in any way�only a phone call from someone inside the palace asking to add Admiral Avila to the guest list. At this point, Bishop Valdespino seemed to be the most obvious suspect, having been privy to Edmond's announcement early enough to formulate a plan to stop it, and also knowing better than anyone just how destructive it might be to the authority of the world's religions. "Obviously, I can't marry Julian," Ambra said quietly. "I keep thinking he'll break off the engagement now that he knows I can't have children. His bloodline has held the crown for most of the last four centuries. Something tells me that a museum administrator from Bilbao will not be the reason the lineage ends." The speaker overhead crackled, and the pilots announced that it was time to prepare for their landing in Barcelona. Jarred from her ruminations about the prince, Ambra stood and began tidying up the cabin�rinsing their glasses in the galley and disposing of the uneaten food. "Professor," Winston chimed from Edmond's phone on the table, "I thought you should be aware that there is new information now going viral online� strong evidence suggesting a secret link between Bishop Valdespino and the assassin Admiral Avila." Langdon was alarmed by the news. "Unfortunately, there is more," Winston added. "As you know, Kirsch's secret meeting with Bishop Valdespino included two other religious leaders�a prominent rabbi and a well-loved imam. Last night, the imam was found dead in the desert near Dubai. And, in the last few minutes, there is troubling news coming out of Budapest: it seems the rabbi has been found dead of an apparent heart attack." Langdon was stunned. "Bloggers," Winston said, "are already questioning the coincidental timing of their deaths." Langdon nodded in mute disbelief. One way or the other, Bishop Antonio Valdespino was now the only living person on earth who knew what Kirsch had discovered. When the Gulfstream G550 touched down onto the lone runway at Sabadell Airport in the foothills of Barcelona, Ambra was relieved to see no signs of waiting paparazzi or press. According to Edmond, in order to avoid dealing with star struck fans at Barcelona's El-Prat Airport, he chose to keep his plane at this small jetport. That was not the real reason, Ambra knew. In reality, Edmond loved attention, and admitted to keeping his plane at Sabadell only to have an excuse to drive the winding roads to his home in his favorite sports car�a Tesla Model X P90D that Elon Musk had allegedly hand- delivered to him as a gift. Supposedly, Edmond had once challenged his jet pilots to a one-mile drag race on the runway�Gulfstream vs. Tesla�but his pilots had done the math and declined. I'll miss Edmond, Ambra thought ruefully. Yes, he was self-indulgent and brash, but his brilliant imagination deserved so much more from life than what happened to him tonight. I just hope we can honor him by unveiling his discovery. When the plane arrived inside Edmond's single-plane hangar and powered down, Ambra could see that everything here was quiet. Apparently, she and Professor Langdon were still flying under the radar. As she led the way down the jet's staircase, Ambra breathed deeply, trying to clear her head. The second glass of wine had taken hold, and she regretted drinking it. Stepping down onto the cement floor of the hangar, she faltered slightly and felt Langdon's strong hand on her shoulder, steadying her. "Thanks," she whispered, smiling back at the professor, whose two cups of coffee had left him looking wide-awake and wired. "We should get out of sight as quickly as possible," Langdon said, eyeing the sleek black SUV parked in the corner. "I assume that's the vehicle you told me about?" She nodded. "Edmond's secret love." "Odd license plate." Ambra eyed the car's vanity plate and chuckled. E-WAVE "Well," she explained, "Edmond told me that Google and NASA recently acquired a groundbreaking supercomputer called D-Wave�one of the world's first �quantum' computers. He tried to explain it to me, but it was pretty complicated�something about superpositions and quantum mechanics and creating an entirely new breed of machine. Anyhow, Edmond said he wanted to build something that would blow D-Wave out of the water. He planned to call his new computer E-Wave." "E for Edmond," Langdon mused. And E is one step beyond D, Ambra thought, recalling Edmond's story about the famous computer in 2001: A Space Odyssey, which, according to urban legend, had been named HAL because each letter occurred alphabetically one letter ahead of IBM. "And the car key?" Langdon asked. "You said you know where he hides it." "He doesn't use a key." Ambra held up Edmond's phone. "He showed me this when we came here last month." She touched the phone screen, launched the Tesla app, and selected the summon command. Instantly, in the corner of the hangar, the SUV's headlights blazed to life, and the Tesla�without the slightest sound�slid smoothly up beside them and stopped. Langdon cocked his head, looking unnerved by the prospect of a car that drove itself. "Don't worry," Ambra assured him. "I'll let you drive to Edmond's apartment." Langdon nodded his agreement and began circling around to the driver's side. As he passed the front of the car, he paused, staring down at the license plate and laughing out loud. Ambra knew exactly what had amused him�Edmond's license-plate frame: AND THE GEEK SHALL INHERIT THE EARTH. "Only Edmond," Langdon said as he climbed in behind the wheel. "Subtlety was never his forte." "He loved this car," Ambra said, getting in next to Langdon. "Fully electric and faster than a Ferrari." Langdon shrugged, eyeing the high-tech dashboard. "I'm not really a car guy." Ambra smiled. "You will be." CHAPTER 48 as Avila'S uber raced eastward through the darkness, the admiral wondered how many times during his years as a naval officer he had made port in Barcelona. His previous life seemed a world away now, having ended in a fiery flash in Seville. Fate was a cruel and unpredictable mistress, and yet there seemed an eerie equilibrium about her now. The same fate that had torn out his soul in the Cathedral of Seville had now granted him a second life�a fresh start born within the sanctuary walls of a very different cathedral. Ironically, the person who had taken him there was a simple physical therapist named Marco. "A meeting with the pope?" Avila had asked his trainer months ago, when Marco first proposed the idea. "Tomorrow? In Rome?" "Tomorrow in Spain," Marco had replied. "The pope is here." Avila eyed him as if he were crazy. "The media have said nothing about His Holiness being in Spain." "A little trust, Admiral," Marco replied with a laugh. "Unless you've got somewhere else to be tomorrow?" Avila glanced down at his injured leg. "We'll leave at nine," Marco prompted. "I promise our little trip will be far less painful than rehab." The next morning, Avila got dressed in a navy uniform that Marco had retrieved from Avila's home, grabbed a pair of crutches, and hobbled out to Marco's car�an old Fiat. Marco drove out of the hospital lot and headed south on Avenida de la Raza, eventually leaving the city and getting on Highway N-IV heading south. "Where are we going?" Avila asked, suddenly uneasy. "Relax," Marco said, smiling. "Just trust me. It'll only take half an hour." Avila knew there was nothing but parched pastureland on the N-IV for at least another 150 kilometers. He was beginning to think he had made a terrible mistake. Half an hour into the journey, they approached the eerie ghost town of El Torbiscal�a once prosperous farming village whose population had recently dwindled to zero. Where in the world is he taking me?! Marco drove on for several minutes, then exited the highway and turned north. "Can you see it?" Marco asked, pointing into the distance across a fallow field. Avila saw nothing. Either the young trainer was hallucinating or Avila's eyes were getting old. "Isn't it amazing?" Marco declared. Avila squinted into the sun, and finally saw a dark form rising out of the landscape. As they drew closer, his eyes widened in disbelief. Is that... a cathedral? The scale of the building looked like something he might expect to see in Madrid or Paris. Avila had lived in Seville his entire life but had never known of a cathedral out here in the middle of nowhere. The closer they drove, the more impressive the complex appeared, its massive cement walls providing a level of security that Avila had seen only in Vatican City. Marco left the main highway and drove along a short access road toward the cathedral, approaching a towering iron gate that blocked their way. As they came to a stop, Marco pulled a laminated card from the glove box and placed it on the dashboard. A security guard approached, eyed the card, and then peered into the vehicle, smiling broadly when he saw Marco. " Bienvenidos ," the guard said. "<? Que tal, Marco ?" The two men shook hands, and Marco introduced Admiral Avila. "Ha venido a conocer al papa," Marco told the guard. He's come to meet the pope. The guard nodded, admiring the medals on Avila's uniform, and waved them on. As the huge gate swung open, Avila felt like he was entering a medieval castle. The soaring Gothic cathedral that appeared before them had eight towering spires, each with a triple-tiered bell tower. A trio of massive cupolas made up the body of the structure, the exterior of which was composed of dark brown and white stone, giving it an unusually modern feel. Avila lowered his gaze to the access road, which forked into three parallel roadways, each lined with a phalanx of tall palm trees. To his surprise, the entire area was jammed with parked vehicles�hundreds of them�luxury sedans, dilapidated buses, mud-covered mopeds ... everything imaginable. Marco bypassed them all, driving straight to the church's front courtyard, where a security guard saw them, checked his watch, and waved them into an empty parking spot that had clearly been reserved for them. "We're a little late," Marco said. "We should hurry inside." Avila was about to reply, but the words were lodged in his throat. He had just seen the sign in front of the church: Iglesia Catolica Palmariana My God! Avila felt himself recoil. I've heard of this church! He turned to Marco, trying to control his pounding heart. "This is your church, Marco?" Avila tried not to sound alarmed. "You're a ... Palmarian ?" Marco smiled. "You say the word like it's some kind of disease. I'm just a devout Catholic who believes that Rome has gone astray." Avila raised his eyes again to the church. Marco's strange claim about knowing the pope suddenly made sense. The pope is here in Spain. A few years ago, the television network Canal Sur had aired a documentary titled La Iglesia Oscura, whose purpose was to unveil some of the secrets of the Palmarian Church. Avila had been stunned to learn of the strange church's existence, not to mention its growing congregation and influence. According to lore, the Palmarian Church had been founded after some local residents claimed to have witnessed a series of mystical visions in a field nearby. Allegedly, the Virgin Mary had appeared to them and warned that the Catholic Church was rife with the "heresy of modernism" and that the true faith needed to be protected. The Virgin Mary had urged the Palmarians to establish an alternative church and denounce the current pope in Rome as a false pope. This conviction that the Vatican's pope was not the valid pontiff was known as sedevacantism �a belief that St. Peter's "seat" was literally "vacant." Furthermore, the Palmarians claimed to have evidence that the "true" pope was in fact their own founder�a man named Clemente Dominguez y Gomez, who took the name Pope Gregory XVII. Under Pope Gregory�the "antipope," in the view of mainstream Catholics�the Palmarian Church grew steadily. In 2005, when Pope Gregory died while presiding over an Easter mass, his supporters hailed the timing of his death as a miraculous sign from above, confirming that this man was in fact connected directly to God. Now, as Avila gazed up at the massive church, he couldn't help but view the building as sinister. Whoever the current antipope might be, I have no interest in meeting him. In addition to criticism over their bold claims about the papacy, the Palmarian Church endured allegations of brainwashing, cultlike intimidation, and even responsibility for several mysterious deaths, including that of church member Bridget Crosbie, who, according to her family's attorneys, had been "unable to escape" one of the Palmarian churches in Ireland. Avila didn't want to be rude to his new friend, but this was not at all what he had expected from today's trip. "Marco," he said with an apologetic sigh, "I'm sorry, but I don't think I can do this." "I had a feeling you were going to say that," Marco replied, seemingly unfazed. "And I admit, I had the same reaction when I first came here. I too had heard all the gossip and dark rumors, but I can assure you, it's nothing more than a smear campaign led by the Vatican." Can you blame them? Avila wondered. Your church declared them illegitimate! "Rome needed a reason to excommunicate us, so they made up lies. For years, the Vatican has been spreading disinformation about the Palmarians." Avila assessed the magnificent cathedral in the middle of nowhere. Something about it felt strange to him. "I'm confused," he said. "If you have no ties to the Vatican, where does all your money come from?" Marco smiled. "You would be amazed at the number of secret followers the Palmarians have within the Catholic clergy. There are many conservative Catholic parishes here in Spain that do not approve of the liberal changes emanating from Rome, and they are quietly funneling money to churches like ours, where traditional values are upheld." The answer was unexpected, but it rang true for Avila. He too had sensed a growing schism within the Catholic Church�a rift between those who believed the Church needed to modernize or die and those who believed the Church's true purpose was to remain steadfast in the face of an evolving world. "The current pope is a remarkable man," Marco said. "I told him your story, and he said he would be honored to welcome a decorated military officer to our church, and meet with you personally after the service today. Like his predecessors, he had a military background before finding God, and he understands what you're going through. I really think his viewpoint might help you find peace." Marco opened his door to get out of the car, but Avila could not move. He just sat in place, staring up at the massive structure, feeling guilty for harboring a blind prejudice against these people. To be fair, he knew nothing of the Palmarian Church except the rumors, and it was not as if the Vatican were without scandal. Moreover, Avila's own church had not helped him at all after the attack. Forgive your enemies, the nun had told him. Turn the other cheek. "Luis, listen to me," Marco whispered. "I realize I tricked you a bit into coming here, but it was with good intentions ... I wanted you to meet this man. His ideas have changed my life dramatically. After I lost my leg, I was in the place where you are now. I wanted to die. I was sinking into darkness, and this man's words gave me a purpose. Just come and hear him preach." Avila hesitated. "I'm happy for you, Marco. But I think I'll be fine on my own." "Fine?" The young man laughed. "A week ago, you put a gun to your head and pulled the trigger! You are not fine, my friend." He's right, Avila knew, and one week from now, when my therapy is done, I will be back home, alone and adrift again. "What are you afraid of?" Marco pressed. "You're a naval officer. A grown man who commanded a ship! Are you afraid the pope is going to brainwash you in ten minutes and take you hostage?" I'm not sure what I'm afraid of, Avila thought, staring down at his injured leg, feeling strangely small and impotent. For most of his life, he had been the one in charge, the one giving orders. He was uncertain about the prospect of taking orders from someone else. "Never mind," Marco finally said, refastening his seat belt. "I'm sorry. I can see you're uncomfortable. I didn't mean to pressure you." He reached down to start the car. Avila felt like a fool. Marco was practically a child, one-third Avila's age, missing a leg, trying to help out a fellow invalid, and Avila had thanked him by being ungrateful, skeptical, and condescending. "No," Avila said. "Forgive me, Marco. I'd be honored to listen to the man preach." CHAPTER 49 the windshield on EdmoncTs Tesla Model X was expansive, morphing seamlessly into the car's roof somewhere behind Langdon's head, giving him the disorienting sense he was floating inside a glass bubble. Guiding the car along the wooded highway north of Barcelona, Langdon was surprised to find himself driving well in excess of the roadway's generous 120 kph speed limit. The vehicle's silent electric engine and linear acceleration seemed to make every speed feel nearly identical. In the seat beside him, Ambra was busy browsing the Internet on the car's massive dashboard computer display, relaying to Langdon the news that was now breaking worldwide. An ever-deepening web of intrigue was emerging, including rumors that Bishop Valdespino had been wiring funds to the antipope of the Palmarian Church�who allegedly had military ties with conservative Carlists and appeared to be responsible not only for Edmond's death, but also for the deaths of Syed al-Fadl and Rabbi Yehuda Koves. As Ambra read aloud, it became clear that media outlets everywhere were now asking the same question: What could Edmond Kirsch possibly have discovered that was so threatening that a prominent bishop and a conservative Catholic sect would murder him in an effort to silence his announcement? "The viewership numbers are incredible," Ambra said, glancing up from the screen. "Public interest in this story is unprecedented ... it seems like the entire world is transfixed." In that instant, Langdon realized that perhaps there was a macabre silver lining to Edmond's horrific murder. With all the media attention, Kirsch's global audience had grown far larger than he could ever have imagined. Right now, even in death, Edmond held the world's ear. The realization made Langdon even more committed to achieving his goal� to find Edmond's forty-seven-letter password and launch his presentation to the world. "There's no statement yet from Julian," Ambra said, sounding puzzled. "Not a single word from the Royal Palace. It makes no sense. I've had personal experience with their PR coordinator, Monica Martin, and she's all about transparency and sharing information before the press can twist it. I'm sure she's urging Julian to make a statement." Langdon suspected she was right. Considering the media was accusing the palace's primary religious adviser of conspiracy�possibly even murder�it seemed logical that Julian should make a statement of some sort, even if only to say that the palace was investigating the accusations. "Especially," Langdon added, "if you consider that the country's future queen consort was standing right beside Edmond when he was shot. It could have been you, Ambra. The prince should at least say he's relieved that you're safe." "I'm not sure he is," she said matter-of-factly, turning off the browser and leaning back in her seat. Langdon glanced over. "Well, for whatever it's worth, I'm glad you're safe. I'm not sure I could have handled tonight all alone." "Alone?" an accented voice demanded through the car's speakers. "How quickly we forget!" Langdon laughed at Winston's indignant outburst. "Winston, did Edmond really program you to be defensive and insecure?" "No," Winston said. "He programmed me to observe, learn, and mimic human behavior. My tone was more an attempt at humor�which Edmond encouraged me to develop. Humor cannot be programmed ... it must be learned." "Well, you're learning well." "Am I?" Winston entreated. "Perhaps you could say that again?" Langdon laughed out loud. "As I said, you're learning well." Ambra had now returned the dashboard display to its default page�a navigation program consisting of a satellite photo on which a tiny "avatar" of their car was visible. Langdon could see that they had wound through the Collserola Mountains and were now merging onto Highway B-20 toward Barcelona. To the south of their location, on the satellite photo, Langdon spotted something unusual that drew his attention�a large forested area in the middle of the urban sprawl. The green expanse was elongated and amorphous, like a giant amoeba. "Is that Parc Giiell?" he asked. Ambra glanced at the screen and nodded. "Good eye." "Edmond stopped there frequently," Winston added, "on his way home from the airport." Langdon was not surprised. Parc Giiell was one of the best-known masterpieces of Antoni Gaudi�the same architect and artist whose work Edmond displayed on his phone case. Gaudi was a lot like Edmond, Langdon thought. A groundbreaking visionary for whom the normal rules did not apply. A devout student of nature, Antoni Gaudi had taken his architectural inspiration from organic forms, using "God's natural world" to help him design fluid biomorphic structures that often appeared to have grown out of the ground themselves. There are no straight lines in nature, Gaud! was once quoted as saying, and indeed, there were very few straight lines in his work either. Often described as the progenitor of "living architecture" and "biological design," Gaudi invented never-before-seen techniques of carpentry, ironwork, glasswork, and ceramics in order to "sheathe" his buildings in dazzling, colorful skins. Even now, nearly a century after Gaudi's death, tourists from around the world traveled to Barcelona to get a glimpse of his inimitable modernist style. His works included parks, public buildings, private mansions, and, of course, his magnum opus�Sagrada Familia�the massive Catholic basilica whose skyscraping "sea sponge spires" dominated Barcelona's skyline, and which critics hailed as being "unlike anything in the entire history of art." Langdon had always marveled at Gaudi's audacious vision for Sagrada Familia�a basilica so colossal that it remained under construction today, nearly 140 years after its groundbreaking. Tonight, as Fangdon eyed the car's satellite image of Gaudi's famous Parc Giiell, he recalled his first visit to the park as a college student�a stroll through a fantasyland of twisting treelike columns supporting elevated walkways, nebulous misshapen benches, grottoes with fountains resembling dragons and fish, and an undulating white wall so distinctively fluid that it looked like the whipping flagellum of a giant single-celled creature. "Edmond loved everything Gaudi," Winston continued, "in particular his concept of nature as organic art." Fangdon's mind touched again on Edmond's discovery. Nature. Organics. The Creation. He flashed on Gaudi's famous Barcelona Panots �hexagonal paving tiles commissioned for the sidewalks of the city. Each tile bore an identical swirling design of seemingly meaningless squiggles, and yet when they were all arranged and rotated as intended, a startling pattern emerged�an underwater seascape that gave the impression of plankton, microbes, and undersea flora� La Sopa Primordial, as the locals often called the design. Gaudi's primordial soup, Fangdon thought, again startled by how perfectly the city of Barcelona dovetailed with Edmond's curiosity about the beginnings of life. The prevailing scientific theory was that life had begun in the earth's primordial soup�those early oceans where volcanoes spewed rich chemicals, which swirled around one another, constantly bombarded by lightning bolts from endless storms ... until suddenly, like some kind of microscopic golem, the first single-celled creature sprang to life. "Ambra," Langdon said, "you're a museum curator�you must have discussed art frequently with Edmond. Did he ever tell you specifically what it was about Gaudi that spoke to him?" "Only what Winston mentioned," she replied. "His architecture feels as if it were created by nature herself. Gaudi's grottoes seem carved by the wind and rain, his supporting pillars seem to have grown out of the earth, and his tile work resembles primitive sea life." She shrugged. "Whatever the reason, Edmond admired Gaudi enough to move to Spain." Langdon glanced over at her, surprised. He knew Edmond owned houses in several countries around the world, but in recent years, he'd chosen to settle in Spain. "You're saying Edmond moved here because of the art of Gaudi?" "I believe he did," Ambra said. "I once asked him, 'Why Spain?' and he told me he had the rare opportunity to rent a unique property here�a property unlike anything else in the world. I assume he meant his apartment," she said. "Where's his apartment?" "Robert, Edmond lived in Casa Mila." Langdon did a double take. "The Casa Mila?" "The one and only," she replied with a nod. "Last year, he rented the entire top floor as his penthouse apartment." Langdon needed a moment to process the news. Casa Mila was one of Gaudi's most famous buildings�a dazzlingly original "house" whose tiered facade and undulating stone balconies resembled an excavated mountain, sparking its now popular nickname "La Pedrera"�meaning "the stone quarry." "Isn't the top floor a Gaudi museum?" Langdon asked, recalling one of his visits to the building in the past. "Yes," Winston offered. "But Edmond made a donation to UNESCO, which protects the house as a World Heritage Site, and they agreed to temporarily close it down and let him live there for two years. After all, there's no shortage of Gaudi art in Barcelona." Edmond lived inside a Gaudi exhibit at Casa Mila? Langdon puzzled. And he moved in for only two years ? Winston chimed in. "Edmond even helped Casa Mila create a new educational video about its architecture. It's worth seeing." "The video is actually quite impressive," Ambra agreed, leaning forward and touching the browser screen. A keyboard appeared, and she typed: Lapedrera.com. "You should watch this." "I'm kind of driving," Langdon replied. Ambra reached over to the steering column and gave two quick pulls on a small lever. Langdon could feel the steering wheel suddenly stiffen in his hands and immediately noticed that the car appeared to be guiding itself, remaining perfectly centered in its lane. "Autopilot," she said. The effect was quite unsettling, and Langdon could not help but leave his hands hovering over the wheel and his foot over the brake. "Relax." Ambra reached over and placed a comforting hand on his shoulder. "It's far safer than a human driver." Reluctantly, Langdon lowered his hands to his lap. "There you go." She smiled. "Now you can watch this Casa Mila video." The video began with a dramatic low shot of pounding surf, as if taken from a helicopter flying only a few feet above the open ocean. Rising in the distance was an island�a stone mountain with sheer cliffs that climbed hundreds of feet above the crashing waves. Text materialized over the mountain. La Pedrera wasn't created by Gaudl. For the next thirty seconds, Langdon watched as the surf began carving the mountain into the distinctive organic-looking exterior of Casa Mila. Next the ocean rushed inside, creating hollows and cavernous rooms, in which waterfalls carved staircases and vines grew, twisting into iron banisters as mosses grew beneath them, carpeting the floors. Finally, the camera pulled back out to sea and revealed the famous image of Casa Mila�"the quarry"�carved into a massive mountain. �La Pedrera� a masterpiece of nature Langdon had to admit, Edmond had a knack for drama. Seeing this computer� generated video made him eager to revisit the famous building. Returning his eyes to the road, Langdon reached down and disengaged the autopilot, taking back control. "Let's just hope Edmond's apartment contains what we're looking for. We need to find that password." CHAPTER 50 commander diego garza led his four armed Guardia agents directly across the center of Plaza de la Armeria, keeping his eyes straight ahead and ignoring the clamoring media outside the fence, all of whom were aiming television cameras at him through the bars and shouting for a comment. At least they'll see that someone is taking action. When he and his team arrived at the cathedral, the main entrance was locked �not surprising at this hour�and Garza began pounding on the door with the handle of his sidearm. No answer. He kept pounding. Finally, the locks turned and the door swung open. Garza found himself face- to-face with a cleaning woman, who looked understandably alarmed by the small army outside the door. "Where is Bishop Valdespino?" Garza demanded. "I ... I don't know," the woman replied. "I know the bishop is here," Garza declared. "And he is with Prince Julian. You haven't seen them?" She shook her head. "I just arrived. I clean on Saturday nights after�" Garza pushed past her, directing his men to spread out through the darkened cathedral. "Lock the door," Garza told the cleaning woman. "And stay out of the way." With that, he cocked his weapon and headed directly for Valdespino's office. Across the plaza, in the palace's basement control room, Monica Martin was standing at the watercooler and taking a pull on a long-overdue cigarette. Thanks to the liberal "politically correct" movement sweeping Spain, smoking in palace offices had been banned, but with the deluge of alleged crimes being pinned on the palace tonight, Martin figured a bit of secondhand smoke was a tolerable infraction. All five news stations on the bank of muted televisions lined up before her continued their live coverage of the assassination of Edmond Kirsch, flagrantly replaying the footage of his brutal murder over and over. Of course, each retransmission was preceded by the usual warning. CAUTION: The following clip contains graphic images that may not be appropriate for all viewers. Shameless, she thought, knowing these warnings were not sensitive network precautions but rather clever teasers to ensure that nobody changed the channel. Martin took another pull on her cigarette, scanning the various networks, most of which were milking the growing conspiracy theories with "Breaking News" headlines and ticker-tape crawls. Futurist killed by Church? Scientific discovery lost forever? Assassin hired by royal family? You're supposed to report the news, she grumbled. Not spread vicious rumors in the form of questions. Martin had always believed in the importance of responsible journalism as a cornerstone of freedom and democracy, and so she was routinely disappointed by journalists who incited controversy by broadcasting ideas that were patently absurd�all the while avoiding legal repercussions by simply turning every ludicrous statement into a leading question. Even respected science channels were doing it, asking their viewers: "Is It Possible That This Temple in Peru Was Built by Ancient Aliens?" No! Martin wanted to shout at the television. It's not freaking possible! Stop asking moronic questions! On one of the television screens, she could see that CNN seemed to be doing its best to be respectful. Remembering Edmond Kirsch Prophet. Visionary. Creator. Martin picked up the remote and turned up the volume. "... a man who loved art, technology, and innovation," said the news anchor sadly. "A man whose almost mystical ability to predict the future made him a household name. According to his colleagues, every single prediction made by Edmond Kirsch in the field of computer science has become a reality." "That's right, David," interjected his female cohost. "I just wish we could say the same for his personal predictions." They now played archival footage of a robust, tanned Edmond Kirsch giving a press conference on the sidewalk outside 30 Rockefeller Center in New York City. "Today I am thirty years old," Edmond said, "and my life expectancy is only sixty-eight. However, with future advances in medicine, longevity technology, and telomere regeneration, I predict I will live to see my hundred- and-tenth birthday. In fact, I am so confident of this fact that I just reserved the Rainbow Room for my hundred-and-tenth-birthday party." Kirsch smiled and gazed up to the top of the building. "I just now paid my entire bill� eighty years in advance�including provisions for inflation." The female anchor returned, sighing somberly. "As the old adage goes: �Men plan, and God laughs.'" "So true," the male host chimed. "And on top of the intrigue surrounding Kirsch's death, there is also an explosion of speculation over the nature of his discovery." He stared earnestly at the camera. "Where do we come from? Where are we going? Two fascinating questions." "And to answer these questions," the female host added excitedly, "we are joined by two very accomplished women�an Episcopal minister from Vermont and an evolutionary biologist from UCLA. We'll be back after the break with their thoughts." Martin already knew their thoughts� polar opposites, or they would not be on your show. No doubt the minister would say something like: "We come from God and we're going to God," and the biologist would respond, "We evolved from apes and we're going extinct." They will prove nothing except that we viewers will watch anything if it's sufficiently hyped. "Monica!" Suresh shouted nearby. Martin turned to see the director of electronic security rounding the corner, practically at a jog. "What is it?" she asked. "Bishop Valdespino just called me," he said breathlessly. She muted the TV. "The bishop called ... you ? Did he tell you what the hell he's doing?!" Suresh shook his head. "I didn't ask, and he didn't offer. He was calling to see if I could check something on our phone servers." "I don't understand." "You know how ConspiracyNet is now reporting that someone inside this palace placed a call to the Guggenheim shortly before tonight's event�a request for Ambra Vidal to add Avila's name to the guest list?" "Yes. And I asked you to look into it." "Well, Valdespino seconded your request. He called to ask if I would log into the palace's switchboard and find the record of that call to see if I could figure out where in the palace it had originated, in hopes of getting a better idea of who here might have placed it." Martin felt confused, having imagined that Valdespino himself was the most likely suspect. "According to the Guggenheim," Suresh continued, "their front desk received a call from Madrid Royal Palace's primary number tonight, shortly before the event. It's in their phone logs. But here's the problem. I looked into our switchboard logs to check our outbound calls with the same time stamp." He shook his head. "Nothing. Not a single call. Someone deleted the record of the palace's call to the Guggenheim." Martin studied her colleague a long moment. "Who has access to do that?" "That's exactly what Valdespino asked me. And so I told him the truth. I told him that I, as head of electronic security, could have deleted the record, but that I had not done so. And that the only other person with clearance and access to those records is Commander Garza." Martin stared. "You think Garza tampered with our phone records?" "It makes sense," Suresh said. "Garza's job, after all, is to protect the palace, and now, if there's any investigation, as far as the palace is concerned, that call never happened. Technically speaking, we have plausible deniability. Deleting the record goes a long way to taking the palace off the hook." "Off the hook?" Martin demanded. "There's no doubt that that call was made! Ambra put Avila on the guest list! And the Guggenheim front desk will verify "True, but now it's the word of a young front-desk person at a museum against the entire Royal Palace. As far as our records are concerned, that call simply didn't occur." Suresh's cut-and-dried assessment seemed overly optimistic to Martin. "And you told Valdespino all of this?" "It's just the truth. I told him that whether or not Garza actually placed the call, Garza appears to have deleted it in an effort to protect the palace." Suresh paused. "But after I hung up with the bishop, I realized something else." "That being?" "Technically, there's a third person with access to the server." Suresh glanced nervously around the room and moved closer. "Prince Julian's log-in codes give him full access to all systems." Martin stared. "That's ridiculous." "I know it sounds crazy," he said, "but the prince was in the palace, alone in his apartment, at the time that call was made. He could easily have placed it and then logged onto the server and deleted it. The software is simple to use and the prince is a lot more tech-sawy than people think." "Suresh," Martin snapped, "do you really think Prince Julian�the future king of Spain �personally sent an assassin into the Guggenheim Museum to kill Edmond Kirsch?" "I don't know," he said. "All I'm saying is that it's possible." "Why would Prince Julian do such a thing?! " "You, of all people, shouldn't have to ask. Remember all the bad press you had to deal with about Ambra and Edmond Kirsch spending time together? The story about how he flew her to his apartment in Barcelona?" "They were working! It was business!" "Politics is all appearances," Suresh said. "You taught me that. And you and I know the prince's marriage proposal has not worked out for him publicly the way he imagined." Suresh's phone pinged and he read the incoming message, his face clouding with disbelief. "What is it?" Martin demanded. Without a word, Suresh turned and ran back toward the security center. "Suresh!" Martin stubbed out her cigarette and ran after him, joining him at one of his team's security workstations, where his tech was playing a grainy surveillance tape. "What are we looking at?" Martin demanded. "Rear exit of the cathedral," the techie said. "Five minutes ago." Martin and Suresh leaned in and watched the video feed as a young acolyte exited the rear of the cathedral, hurried along the relatively quiet Calle Mayor, unlocked an old beat-up Opel sedan, and climbed in. Okay, Martin thought, he's going home after mass. So what? On-screen, the Opel pulled out, drove a short distance, and then pulled up unusually close to the cathedral's rear gate�the same gate through which the acolyte had just exited. Almost instantly, two dark figures slipped out through the gate, crouching low, and jumped into the backseat of the acolyte's car. The two passengers were�without a doubt�Bishop Valdespino and Prince Julian. Moments later, the Opel sped off, disappearing around the corner and out of frame. CHAPTER 51 standing like a rough-hewn mountain on the corner of Carrer de Proven^a and Passeig de Gracia, the 1906 Gaudi masterpiece known as Casa Mila is half apartment building and half timeless work of art. Conceived by Gaudi as a perpetual curve, the nine-story structure is immediately recognizable by its billowing limestone facade. Its swerving balconies and uneven geometry give the building an organic aura, as if millennia of buffeting winds had carved out hollows and bends like those in a desert canyon. Although Gaudi's shocking modernist design was shunned at first by the neighborhood, Casa Mila was universally lauded by art critics and quickly became one of Barcelona's brightest architectural jewels. For three decades, Pere Mila, the businessman who commissioned the building, had resided with his wife in the sprawling main apartment while renting out the building's twenty remaining flats. To this day, Casa Mila�at Passeig de Gracia 92�is considered one of the most exclusive and coveted addresses in all of Spain. As Robert Langdon navigated Kirsch's Tesla through sparse traffic on the elegant tree-lined avenue, he sensed they were getting close. Passeig de Gracia was Barcelona's version of the Champs-Elysees in Paris�the widest and grandest of avenues, impeccably landscaped and lined with designer boutiques. Chanel... Gucci ... Cartier ... Longchamp ... Finally, Langdon saw it, two hundred meters away. Softly lit from below, Casa Mila's pale, pitted limestone and oblong balconies set it instantly apart from its rectilinear neighbors�as if a beautiful piece of ocean coral had washed into shore and come to rest on a beach made of cinder blocks. "I was afraid of this," Ambra said, pointing urgently down the elegant avenue. "Look." Langdon lowered his gaze to the wide sidewalk in front of Casa Mila. It looked like there were a half-dozen media trucks parked in front, and a host of reporters were giving live updates using Kirsch's residence as a backdrop. Several security agents were positioned to keep the crowds away from the entrance. Edmond's death, it seemed, had transformed anything Kirsch-related into a news story. Langdon scanned Passeig de Gracia for a place to pull over, but he saw nothing, and traffic was moving steadily. "Get down," he urged Ambra, realizing he had no choice now but to drive directly past the corner where all the press were assembled. Ambra slid down in her seat, crouching on the floor, entirely out of view. Langdon turned his head away as they drove past the crowded corner. "It looks like they're surrounding the main entrance," he said. "We'll never get in." "Take a right," Winston interjected with a note of cheerful confidence. "I imagined this might happen." Blogger Hector Marcano gazed up mournfully at the top floor of Casa Mila, still trying to accept that Edmond Kirsch was truly gone. For three years, Hector had been reporting on technology for Barcinno.com� a popular collaborative platform for Barcelona's entrepreneurs and cutting-edge start-ups. Having the great Edmond Kirsch living here in Barcelona had felt almost like working at the feet of Zeus himself. Hector had first met Kirsch more than a year ago when the legendary futurist graciously agreed to speak at Barcinno's flagship monthly event�FuckUp Night �a seminar in which a wildly successful entrepreneur spoke openly about his or her biggest failures. Kirsch sheepishly admitted to the crowd that he had spent more than $400 million over six months chasing his dream of building what he called E-Wave�a quantum computer with processing speeds so fast they would facilitate unprecedented advances across all the sciences, especially in complex systems modeling. "I'm afraid," Edmond had admitted, "so far, my quantum leap in quantum computing is a quantum dud." Tonight, when Hector heard that Kirsch planned to announce an earth- shattering discovery, he was thrilled at the thought that it might be related to E- Wave. Did he discover the key to making it work? But after Kirsch's philosophical preamble, Hector realized his discovery was something else entirely. I wonder if we 'll ever know what he found, Hector thought, his heart so heavy that he had come to Kirsch's home not to blog, but to pay reverent homage. "E-Wave!" someone shouted nearby. "E-Wave!" All around Hector, the assembled crowd began pointing and aiming their cameras at a sleek black Tesla that was now easing slowly onto the plaza and inching toward the crowd with its halogen headlights glaring. Hector stared at the familiar vehicle in astonishment. Kirsch's Tesla Model X with its E-Wave license plate was as famous in Barcelona as the pope-mobile was in Rome. Kirsch would often make a show of double-parking on Carrer de Proven^a outside the DANiEL ViOR jewelry shop, getting out to sign autographs and then thrilling the crowd by letting his car's self-park feature drive the empty vehicle on a preprogrammed route up the street and across the wide sidewalk�its sensors detecting any pedestrians or obstacles �until it reached the garage gate, which it would then open, and slowly wind down the spiral ramp into the private garage beneath Casa Mila. While self-park was a standard feature on all Teslas�easily opening garage doors, driving straight in, and turning themselves off�Edmond had proudly hacked his Tesla's system to enable the more complex route. All part of the show. Tonight, the spectacle was considerably stranger. Kirsch was deceased, and yet his car had just appeared, moving slowly up Carrer de Proven^a, continuing across the sidewalk, aligning itself with the elegant garage door, and inching forward as people cleared the way. Reporters and cameramen rushed to the vehicle, squinting through the heavily tinted windows and shouting in surprise. "It's empty! Nobody is driving! Where did it come from?!" The Casa Mila security guards had apparently witnessed this trick before, and they held people back from the Tesla and away from the garage door as it opened. For Hector, the sight of Edmond's empty car creeping toward its garage conjured images of a bereft dog returning home after losing its master. Like a ghost, the Tesla made its way silently through the garage door, and the crowd broke into emotional applause to see Edmond's beloved car, as it had done so many times before, begin its descent down the spiral ramp into Barcelona's very first subterranean parking facility. "I didn't know you were so claustrophobic," Ambra whispered, lying beside Langdon on the floor of the Tesla. They were crammed into the small area between the second and third row of seats, hidden beneath a black vinyl car cover that Ambra had taken from the cargo area, invisible through the tinted windows. "I'll survive," Langdon managed shakily, more nervous about the self-driving car than his phobia. He could feel the vehicle winding down a steep spiral ramp and feared it would crash at any moment. Two minutes earlier, while they were double-parked on Carrer de Proven^a, outside the DANiEL ViOR jewelry shop, Winston had given them crystal-clear directions. Ambra and Langdon, without exiting the car, had climbed back to the Model X's third row of seats, and then with the press of a single button on the phone, Ambra had activated the car's customized self-park feature. In the darkness, Langdon had felt the car driving itself slowly down the street. And with Ambra's body pressed against his in the tight space, he could not help but recall his first teenage experience in the backseat of a car with a pretty girl. / was more nervous back then, he thought, which seemed ironic considering he was now lying in a driverless car spooning the future queen of Spain. Langdon felt the car straighten out at the bottom of the ramp, make a few slow turns, and then slide to a full stop. "You have arrived," Winston said. Immediately Ambra pulled back the tarp and carefully sat up, peering out the window. "Clear," she said, clambering out. Langdon got out after her, relieved to be standing in the open air of the garage. "Elevators are in the main foyer," Ambra said, motioning up the winding driveway ramp. Langdon's gaze, however, was suddenly transfixed by a wholly unexpected sight. Here, in this underground parking garage, on the cement wall directly in front of Edmond's parking space, hung an elegantly framed painting of a seaside landscape. "Ambra?" Langdon said. "Edmond decorated his parking spot with a painting?" She nodded. "I asked him the same question. He told me it was his way of being welcomed home every night by a radiant beauty." Langdon chuckled. Bachelors. "The artist is someone Edmond revered greatly," Winston said, his voice now transferring automatically to Kirsch's cell phone in Ambra's hand. "Do you recognize him?" Langdon did not. The painting seemed to be nothing more than an accomplished watercolor seascape�nothing like Edmond's usual avant-garde taste. "It's Churchill," Ambra said. "Edmond quoted him all the time." Churchill. Langdon needed a moment to realize she was referring to none other than Winston Churchill himself, the celebrated British statesman who, in addition to being a military hero, historian, orator, and Nobel Prize-winning author, was an artist of remarkable talent. Langdon now recalled Edmond quoting the British prime minister once in response to a comment someone made about religious people hating him: You have enemies? Good. That means you've stood up for something! "It was the diversity of Churchill's talents that most impressed Edmond," Winston said. "Humans rarely display proficiency across such a broad spectrum of activities." "And that's why Edmond named you �Winston'?" "It is," the computer replied. "High praise from Edmond." Glad I asked, Langdon thought, having imagined Winston's name was an allusion to Watson�the IBM computer that had dominated the Jeopardy! television game show a decade ago. No doubt Watson was probably now considered a primitive, single-celled bacterium on the evolutionary scale of synthetic intelligence. "Okay, then," Langdon said, motioning to the elevators. "Let's head upstairs and try to find what we came for." At that precise moment, inside Madrid's Almudena Cathedral, Commander Diego Garza was clutching his phone and listening in disbelief as the palace's PR coordinator, Monica Martin, gave him an update. Valdespino and Prince Julian left the safety of the compound? Garza could not begin to imagine what they were thinking. They're driving around Madrid in an acolyte's car? That's madness! "We can contact the transportation authorities," Martin said. "Suresh believes they can use traffic cams to help track�" "No!" Garza declared. "Alerting anyone to the fact that the prince is outside the palace without security is far too dangerous! His safety is our primary concern." "Understood, sir," Martin said, sounding suddenly uneasy. "There's something else you should know. It's about a missing phone record." "Hold on," Garza said, distracted by the arrival of his four Guardia agents, who, to his mystification, strode over and encircled him. Before Garza could react, his agents had skillfully relieved him of his sidearm and phone. "Commander Garza," his lead agent said, stone-faced. "I have direct orders to place you under arrest." CHAPTER 52 casa milA is built in the shape of an infinity sign�an endless curve that doubles back over itself and forms two undulating chasms that penetrate the building. Each of these open-air light wells is nearly a hundred feet deep, crumpled like a partially collapsed tube, and from the air they resembled two massive sinkholes in the roof of the building. From where Langdon stood at the base of the narrower light well, the effect looking skyward was decidedly unsettling�like being lodged in the throat of a giant beast. Beneath Langdon's feet, the stone floor was sloped and uneven. A helix staircase spiraled up the interior of the shaft, its railing forged of wrought iron latticework that mimicked the uneven chambers of a sea sponge. A small jungle of twisting vines and swooping palms spilled over the banisters as if about to overgrow the entire space. Living architecture, Langdon mused, marveling at Gaudi's ability to imbue his work with an almost biological quality. Langdon's eyes climbed higher again, up the sides of the "gorge," scaling the curved walls, where a quilt of brown and green tiles intermingled with muted frescoes depicting plants and flowers that seemed to be growing up toward the oblong patch of night sky at the top of the open shaft. "Elevators are this way," Ambra whispered, leading him around the edge of the courtyard. "Edmond's apartment is all the way up." As they boarded the uncomfortably small elevator, Langdon pictured the building's top-floor garret, which he had visited once to see the small Gaudi exhibit housed there. As he recalled, the Casa Mila attic was a dark, sinuous series of rooms with very few windows. "Edmond could live anywhere ," Langdon said as the elevator began to climb. "I still can't believe he leased an attic." "It's a strange apartment," Ambra agreed. "But as you know, Edmond was eccentric." When the elevator reached the top floor, they disembarked into an elegant hallway and climbed an additional set of winding stairs to a private landing at the very top of the building. "This is it," Ambra said, motioning to a sleek metal door that had no knob or keyhole. The futuristic portal looked entirely out of place in this building and clearly had been added by Edmond. "You said you know where he hides his key?" Langdon asked. Ambra held up Edmond's phone. "The same place where he seems to hide everything." She pressed the phone against the metal door, which beeped three times, and Langdon heard a series of dead bolts sliding open. Ambra pocketed the phone and pushed the door open. "After you," she said with a flourish. Langdon stepped over the threshold into a dimly lit foyer whose walls and ceiling were pale brick. The floor was stone, and the air tasted thin. As he moved through the entryway into the open space beyond, he found himself face-to-face with a massive painting, which hung on the rear wall, impeccably illuminated by museum-quality pin lights. When Langdon saw the work, he stopped dead in his tracks. "My God, is that ... the original?" Ambra smiled. "Yes, I was going to mention it on the plane, but I thought I'd surprise you." Speechless, Langdon moved toward the masterpiece. It was about twelve feet long and more than four feet tall�far larger than he recalled from seeing it previously in the Boston Museum of Line Arts. I heard this was sold to an anonymous collector, but I had no idea it was Edmond! "When I first saw it in the apartment," Ambra said, "I could not believe that Edmond had a taste for this style of art. But now that I know what he was working on this year, the painting seems eerily appropriate." Langdon nodded, incredulous. This celebrated masterpiece was one of the signature works by Lrench Postimpressionist Paul Gauguin�a groundbreaking painter who epitomized the Symbolist movement of the late 1800s and helped pave the way for modern art. As Langdon moved toward the painting, he was immediately struck by how similar Gauguin's palette was to that of the Casa Mila entryway�a blend of organic greens, browns, and blues�also depicting a very naturalistic scene. Despite the intriguing collection of people and animals that appeared in Gauguin's painting, Langdon's gaze moved immediately to the upper-left-hand corner�to a bright yellow patch, on which was inscribed the title of this work. Langdon read the words in disbelief: D'oii Venons Nous / Que Sommes Nous / Oil Allons Nous. Where do we come from? What are we? Where are we going? Langdon wondered if being confronted by these questions every day as he returned to his home had somehow helped inspire Edmond. Ambra joined Langdon in front of the painting. "Edmond said he wanted to be motivated by these questions whenever he entered his home." Hard to miss, Langdon thought. Seeing how prominently Edmond had displayed the masterpiece, Langdon wondered if perhaps the painting itself might hold some clue as to what Edmond had discovered. At first glance, the painting's subject seemed far too primitive to hint at an advanced scientific discovery. Its broad uneven brushstrokes depicted a Tahitian jungle inhabited by an assortment of native Tahitians and animals. Langdon knew the painting well, and as he recalled, Gauguin intended this work to be "read" from right to left�in the reverse direction from that of standard French text. And so Langdon's eye quickly traced the familiar figures in reverse direction. On the far right, a newborn baby slept on a boulder, representing life's beginning. Where do we come from ? In the middle, an assortment of people of different ages carried out the daily activities of life. What are we? And on the left, a decrepit old woman sat alone, deep in thought, seeming to ponder her own mortality. Where are we going? Langdon was surprised that he hadn't thought of this painting immediately when Edmond first described the focus of his discovery. What is our origin? What is our destiny? Langdon eyed the other elements of the painting�dogs, cats, and birds, which seemed to be doing nothing in particular; a primitive goddess statue in the background; a mountain, twisting roots, and trees. And, of course, Gauguin's famous "strange white bird," which sat beside the elderly woman and, according to the artist, represented "the futility of words." Futile or not, Langdon thought, words are what we came here for. Preferably forty-seven characters'worth. For an instant, he wondered if the painting's unusual title might relate directly to the forty-seven-letter password they were seeking, but a quick count in both French and English did not add up. "Okay, we're looking for a line of poetry," Langdon said hopefully. "Edmond's library is this way," Ambra told him. She pointed to her left, down a wide corridor, which Langdon could see was appointed with elegant home furnishings that were interspersed with assorted Gaudi artifacts and displays. Edmond lives in a museum? Langdon still couldn't quite wrap his mind around it. The Casa Mila loft was not exactly the homiest place he had ever seen. Constructed entirely of stone and brick, it was essentially a continuous ribbed tunnel�a loop of 270 parabolic arches of varying heights, each about a yard apart. There were very few windows, and the atmosphere tasted dry and sterile, clearly heavily processed to protect the Gaudi artifacts. "ITl join you in a moment," Langdon said. "First, I'm going to find Edmond's restroom." Ambra glanced awkwardly back toward the entrance. "Edmond always asked me to use the lobby downstairs ... he was mysteriously protective of this apartment's private bathroom." "It's a bachelor pad�his bathroom is probably a mess, and he was embarrassed." Ambra smiled. "Well, I think it's that way." She pointed in the opposite direction from the library, down a very dark tunnel. "Thanks. I'll be right back." Ambra headed off toward Edmond's office, and Langdon went in the opposite direction, making his way down the narrow corridor�a dramatic tunnel of brick archways that reminded him of an underground grotto or medieval catacomb. Eerily, as he moved along the stone tunnel, banks of soft motion-sensitive lights illuminated at the base of each parabolic arch, lighting his way. Langdon passed an elegant reading area, a small exercise area, and even a pantry, all interspersed with various display tables of Gaudi drawings, architectural sketches, and 3-D models of his projects. When he passed an illuminated display table of biological artifacts, however, Langdon stopped short, surprised by the contents�a fossil of a prehistoric fish, an elegant nautilus shell, and a sinuous skeleton of a snake. For a passing moment, Langdon imagined Edmond must have mounted this scientific display himself�perhaps relating to his studies of the origins of life. Then Langdon saw the annotation on the case and realized that these artificts had belonged to Gaudi and echoed various architectural features of this home: the fish scales were the tiled patterns on the walls, the nautilus was the curling ramp into the garage, and the snake skeleton with its hundreds of closely spaced ribs was this very hallway. Accompanying the display were the architect's humble words: Nothing is invented, for it's written in nature first. Originality consists of returning to the origin. �ANTONI GAUDI Langdon turned his eyes down the winding, vault-ribbed corridor and once again felt like he was standing inside a living creature. A perfect home for Edmond, he decided. Art inspired by science. As Langdon followed the first bend in the serpentine tunnel, the space widened, and the motion-activated lights illuminated. His gaze was drawn immediately to a huge glass display case in the center of the hall. A catenary model, he thought, having always marveled at these ingenious Gaudi prototypes. "Catenary" was an architectural term that referred to the curve that was formed by a cord hanging loosely between two fixed points�like a hammock or the velvet rope suspended between two stanchions in a theater. In the catenary model before Langdon, dozens of chains had been suspended loosely from the top of the case�resulting in long lengths that swooped down and then back up to form limply hanging U-shapes. Because gravitational tension was the inverse of gravitational compression, Gaudi could study the precise shape assumed by a chain when naturally hanging under its own weight, and he could mimic that shape to solve the architectural challenges of gravitational compression. But it requires a magic mirror, Langdon mused, moving toward the case. As anticipated, the floor of the case was a mirror, and as he peered down into the reflection, he saw a magical effect. The entire model flipped upside down�and the hanging loops became soaring spires. In this case, Langdon realized, he was seeing an inverted aerial view of Gaudi's towering Basilica de la Sagrada Familia, whose gently sloping spires quite possibly had been designed using this very model. Pressing on down the hall, Langdon found himself in an elegant sleeping space with an antique four-poster bed, a cherrywood armoire, and an inlaid chest of drawers. The walls were decorated with Gaudi design sketches, which Langdon realized were simply more of the museum's exhibit. The only piece of art in the room that seemed to have been added was a large calligraphied quote hanging over Edmond's bed. Langdon read the first three words and immediately recognized the source. God is dead. God remains dead. And we have killed him. How shall we comfort ourselves, the murderers of all murderers? �NIETZSCHE "God is dead" were the three most famous words written by Friedrich Nietzsche, the renowned nineteenth-century German philosopher and atheist. Nietzsche was notorious for his scathing critiques of religion, but also for his reflections on science�especially Darwinian evolution�which he believed had transported humankind to the brink of nihilism, an awareness that life had no meaning, no higher purpose, and offered no direct evidence of the existence of God. Seeing the quote over the bed, Langdon wondered if perhaps Edmond, for all his antireligious bluster, might have been struggling with his own role in attempting to rid the world of God. The Nietzsche quote, as Langdon recalled, concluded with the words: "Is not the greatness of this deed too great for us? Must we ourselves not become gods simply to appear worthy of it?" This bold idea�that man must become God in order to kill God�was at the core of Nietzsche's thinking, and perhaps, Langdon realized, partially explained the God complexes suffered by so many pioneering technology geniuses like Edmond. Those who erase God ... must be gods. As Langdon pondered the notion, he was struck by a second realization. Nietzsche was not just a philosopher�he was also a poet! Langdon himself owned Nietzsche's The Peacock and the Buffalo, a compilation of 275 poems and aphorisms that offered thoughts on God, death, and the human mind. Langdon quickly counted the characters in the framed quote. They were not a match, and yet a surge of hope swelled within him. Could Nietzsche be the poet of the line we're seeking? If so, will we find a book of Nietzsche's poetry in Edmond's office? Either way, Langdon would ask Winston to access an online compilation of Nietzsche's poems and search them all for a line containing forty- seven characters. Eager to get back to Ambra and share his thoughts, Langdon hurried through the bedroom into the restroom that was visible beyond. As he entered, the lights inside came on to reveal an elegantly decorated bathroom containing a pedestal sink, a freestanding shower unit, and a toilet. Langdon's eyes were drawn immediately to a low antique table cluttered with toiletries and personal items. When he saw the items on the table, he inhaled sharply, taking a step back. Oh God. Edmond ...no. The table before him looked like a back-alley drug lab�used syringes, pill bottles, loose capsules, and even a rag spotted with blood. Langdon's heart sank. Edmond was taking drugs ? Langdon knew that chemical addiction had become painfully commonplace these days, even among the rich and famous. Heroin was cheaper than beer now, and people were popping opioid painkillers like they were ibuprofen. Addiction would certainly explain his recent weight loss, Langdon thought, wondering if maybe Edmond had been pretending to have "gone vegan" only in an attempt to cover for his thinness and sunken eyes. Langdon walked to the table and picked up one of the bottles, reading the prescription label, fully expecting to find one of the common opioids like OxyContin or Percocet. Instead he saw: Docetaxel. Puzzled, he checked another bottle: Gemcitabine. What are these? he wondered, checking a third bottle: Fluorouracil. Langdon froze. He had heard of Lluorouracil through a colleague at Harvard, and he felt a sudden wave of dread. An instant later, he spied a pamphlet lying among the bottles. The title was "Does Veganism Slow Pancreatic Cancer?" Langdon's jaw dropped as the truth hit him. Edmond wasn't a drug addict. He was secretly fighting a deadly cancer. CHAPTER 53 ambra vidal stood in the soft light of the attic apartment and ran her eyes across the rows of books lining the walls of Edmond's library. His collection is larger than I remembered. Edmond had transformed a wide section of curved hallway into a stunning library by building shelves between the vertical supports of Gaudi's vaults. His library was unexpectedly large and well stocked, especially considering Edmond had allegedly planned to be here for only two years. It looks like he moved in for good. Eyeing the crowded shelves, Ambra realized that locating Edmond's favorite line of poetry would be far more time-consuming than anticipated. As she continued walking along the shelves, scanning the spines of the books, she saw nothing but scientific tomes on cosmology, consciousness, and artificial intelligence: THE BIG PICTURE FORCES OF NATURE ORIGINS OF CONSCIOUSNESS THE BIOLOGY OF BELIEF INTELLIGENT ALGORITHMS OUR FINAL INVENTION She reached the end of one section and stepped around an architectural rib into the next section of shelves. Here she found a wide array of scientific topics �thermodynamics, primordial chemistry, psychology. No poetry. Noting that Winston had been quiet for some time now, Ambra pulled out Kirsch's cell phone. "Winston? Are we still connected?" "I am here," his accented voice chimed. "Did Edmond actually read all of these books in his library?" "I believe so, yes," Winston replied. "He was a voracious consumer of text and called this library his �trophy room of knowledge.'" "And is there, by any chance, a poetry section in here?" "The only titles of which I'm specifically aware are the nonfiction volumes that I was asked to read in e-book format so Edmond and I could discuss their contents�an exercise, I suspect, that was more for my education than for his. Unfortunately, I do not have this entire collection cataloged, so the only way you will be able to find what you are looking for will be by an actual physical search." "I understand." "While you search, there is one thing, I think, that may interest you�breaking news from Madrid regarding your fiance, Prince Julian." "What's happening?" Ambra demanded, halting abruptly. Her emotions still churned over Julian's possible involvement in Kirsch's assassination. There's no proof, she reminded herself. Nothing confirms that Julian helped put Avila's name on the guest list. "It was just reported," Winston said, "that a raucous demonstration is forming outside the Royal Palace. Evidence continues to suggest that Edmond's assassination was secretly arranged by Bishop Valdespino, probably with the help of someone inside the palace, perhaps even the prince. Fans of Kirsch are now picketing. Have a look." Edmond's smartphone began streaming footage of angry protesters at the palace gates. One carried a sign in English that read: pontius pilate killed your PROPHET�YOU KILLED OURS\ Others were carrying spray-painted bedsheets emblazoned with a single-word battle cry � japostasia !� accompanied by a logo that was now being stenciled with increasing frequency on the sidewalks of Madrid. Apostasy had become a popular rallying cry for Spain's liberal youth. Renounce the Church! "Has Julian made a statement yet?" Ambra asked. "That's one of the problems," Winston replied. "Not a word from Julian, nor the bishop, nor anyone at all in the palace. The continued silence has made everyone suspicious. Conspiracy theories are rampant, and the national press has now begun questioning where you are, and why you have not commented publicly on this crisis either?" "Me?!" Ambra was horrified at the thought. "You witnessed the murder. You are the future queen consort and the love of Prince Julian's life. The public wants to hear you say that you are certain Julian is not involved." Ambra's gut told her that Julian could not possibly have known about Edmond's murder; when she thought back to their courtship, she recalled a tender and sincere man�admittedly naive and impulsively romantic�but certainly no murderer. "Similar questions are surfacing now about Professor Langdon," Winston said. "Media outlets have begun asking why the professor has disappeared without comment, especially after featuring so prominently in Edmond's presentation. Several conspiracy blogs are suggesting that his disappearance may actually be related to his involvement in Kirsch's murder." "But that's crazy!" "The topic is gaining traction. The theory stems from Langdon's past search for the Holy Grail and the bloodline of Christ. Apparently, the Salic descendants of Christ have historical ties to the Carlist movement, and the assassin's tattoo 55 "Stop," Ambra interrupted. "This is absurd." "And yet others are speculating that Langdon has disappeared because he himself has become a target tonight. Everyone has become an armchair detective. Much of the world is collaborating at this moment to figure out what mysteries Edmond uncovered ... and who wanted to silence him." Ambra's attention was drawn by the sound of Langdon's footsteps approaching briskly up the winding corridor. She turned just as he appeared around the corner. "Ambra?" he called, his voice taut. "Were you aware that Edmond was seriously ill?" "Ill?" she said, startled. "No." Langdon told her what he had found in Edmond's private bathroom. Ambra was thunderstruck. Pancreatic cancer? That's the reason Edmond was so pale and thin? Incredibly, Edmond had never said a word about being ill. Ambra now understood his maniacal work ethic over the past few months. Edmond knew he was running out of time. "Winston," she demanded. "Did you know about Edmond's illness?" "Yes," Winston replied without hesitation. "It was something he kept very private. He learned of his disease twenty-two months ago and immediately changed his diet and began working with increased intensity. He also relocated to this attic space, where he would breathe museum-quality air and be protected from UV radiation; he needed to live in darkness as much as possible because his medications made him photosensitive. Edmond managed to outlive his doctors' projections by a considerable margin. Recently, though, he had started to fail. Based on empirical evidence I gathered from worldwide databases on pancreatic cancer, I analyzed Edmond's deterioration and calculated that he had nine days to live." Nine days, Ambra thought, overcome with guilt for teasing Edmond about his vegan diet and about working too hard. The man was sick; he was racing tirelessly to create his final moment of glory before his time ran out. This sad realization only further fueled Ambra's determination to locate this poem and complete what Edmond had started. "I haven't found any poetry books yet," she said to Langdon. "So far, it's all science." "I think the poet we're looking for might be Friedrich Nietzsche," Langdon said, telling her about the framed quote over Edmond's bed. "That particular quote doesn't have forty-seven letters, but it certainly implies Edmond was a fan of Nietzsche." "Winston," Ambra said. "Can you search Nietzsche's collected works of poetry and isolate any lines that have exactly forty-seven letters?" "Certainly," Winston replied. "German originals or English translations?" Ambra paused, uncertain. "Start with English," Langdon prompted. "Edmond planned to input the line of poetry on his phone, and his keypad would have no easy way to input any of German's umlauted letters or Eszetts." Ambra nodded. Smart. "I have your results," Winston announced almost immediately. "I have found nearly three hundred translated poems, resulting in one hundred and ninety-two lines of precisely forty-seven letters." Langdon sighed. "That many?" "Winston," Ambra pressed. "Edmond described his favorite line as a prophecy ... a prediction about the future ... one that was already coming true. Do you see anything that fits that description?" "I'm sorry," Winston replied. "I see nothing here that suggests a prophecy. Linguistically speaking, the lines in question are all extracted from longer stanzas and appear to be partial thoughts. Shall I display them for you?" "There are too many," Langdon said. "We need to find a physical book and hope that Edmond marked his favorite line in some way." "Then I suggest you hurry," Winston said. "It appears your presence here may no longer be a secret." "Why do you say that?" Langdon demanded. "Local news is reporting that a military plane has just landed at Barcelona's El Prat Airport and that two Guardia Real agents have deplaned." On the outskirts of Madrid, Bishop Valdespino was feeling grateful to have escaped the palace before the walls had closed in on him. Wedged beside Prince Julian in the backseat of his acolyte's tiny Opel sedan, Valdespino hoped that desperate measures now being enacted behind the scenes would help him regain control of a night careening wildly off course. "La Casita del Principe," Valdespino had ordered the acolyte as the young man drove them away from the palace. The cottage of the prince was situated in a secluded rural area forty minutes outside Madrid. More mansion than cottage, the casita had served as the private residence for the heir to the Spanish throne since the middle of the 1700s�a secluded spot where boys could be boys before settling into the serious business of running a country. Valdespino had assured Julian that retiring to his cottage would be far safer than remaining in the palace tonight. Except I am not taking Julian to the cottage, the bishop knew, glancing over at the prince, who was gazing out the car window, apparently deep in thought. Valdespino wondered if the prince was truly as naive as he appeared, or if, like his father, Julian had mastered the skill of showing the world only that side of himself that he wanted to be seen. CHAPTER 54 the handcuffs on Garza's wrists felt unnecessarily tight. These guys are serious, he thought, still utterly bewildered by the actions of his own Guardia agents. "What the hell is going on?!" Garza demanded again as his men marched him out of the cathedral and into the night air of the plaza. Still no reply. As the entourage moved across the wide expanse toward the palace, Garza realized there was an array of TV cameras and protesters outside the front gate. "At least take me around back," he said to his lead man. "Don't make this a public spectacle." The soldiers ignored his plea and pressed on, forcing Garza to march directly across the plaza. Within seconds, voices outside the gate started shouting, and the blazing glare of spotlights swung toward him. Blinded and fuming, Garza forced himself to assume a calm expression and hold his head high as the Guardia marched him within a few yards of the gate, directly past the yelling cameramen and reporters. A cacophony of voices began hurling questions at Garza. "Why are you being arrested?" "What did you do, Commander?" "Were you involved in the assassination of Edmond Kirsch?" Garza fully expected his agents to continue past the crowd without even a glance, but to his shock, the agents stopped abruptly, holding him still in front of the cameras. From the direction of the palace, a familiar pantsuited figure was striding briskly across the plaza toward them. It was Monica Martin. Garza had no doubt that she would be stunned to see his predicament. Strangely, though, when Martin arrived she eyed him not with surprise, but with contempt. The guards forcibly turned Garza to face the reporters. Monica Martin held up her hand to quiet the crowd and then drew a small sheet of paper from her pocket. Adjusting her thick glasses, she read a statement directly into the television cameras. "The Royal Palace," she announced, "is hereby arresting Commander Diego Garza for his role in the murder of Edmond Kirsch, as well as his attempts to implicate Bishop Valdespino in that crime." Before Garza could even process the preposterous accusation, the guards were muscling him off toward the palace. As he departed, he could hear Monica Martin continuing her statement. "Regarding our future queen, Ambra Vidal," she declared, "and the American professor Robert Langdon, I'm afraid I have some deeply disturbing news." Downstairs in the palace, director of electronic security Suresh Bhalla stood in front of the television, riveted by the live broadcast of Monica Martin's impromptu press conference in the plaza. She does not look happy. Only five minutes ago, Martin had received a personal phone call, which she had taken in her office, speaking in hushed tones and taking careful notes. Sixty seconds later, she had emerged, looking as shaken as Suresh had ever seen her. With no explanation, Martin carried her notes directly out to the plaza and addressed the media. Whether or not her claims were accurate, one thing was certain�the person who had ordered this statement had just placed Robert Langdon in very serious danger. Who gave those orders to Monica? Suresh wondered. As he tried to make sense of the PR coordinator's bizarre behavior, his computer pinged with an incoming message. Suresh went over and eyed the screen, stunned to see who had written him. monte@iglesia.org The informant, thought Suresh. It was the same person who had been feeding information to ConspiracyNet all night. And now, for some reason, that person was contacting Suresh directly. Warily, Suresh sat down and opened the e-mail. It read: i hacked valdespino's texts. he has dangerous secrets. the palace should access his sms records. now. Alarmed, Suresh read the message again. Then he deleted it. For a long moment, he sat in silence, pondering his options. Then, coming to a decision, he quickly generated a master key card to the royal apartments and slipped upstairs unseen. CHAPTER 55 with increasing urgency, Langdon ran his eyes along the collection of books lining Edmond's hallway. Poetry... there's got to be some poetry here somewhere. The Guardia's unexpected arrival in Barcelona had started a dangerous ticking clock, and yet Langdon felt confident that time would not run out. After all, once he and Ambra had located Edmond's favorite line of poetry, they would need only seconds to enter it into Edmond's phone and play the presentation for the world. As Edmond intended. Langdon glanced over at Ambra, who was on the opposite side of the hall, farther down, continuing her search of the left-hand side as Langdon combed the right. "Do you see anything over there?" Ambra shook her head. "So far only science and philosophy. No poetry. No Nietzsche." "Keep looking," Langdon told her, returning to his search. Currently, he was scanning a section of thick tomes on history: PRIVILEGE, PERSECUTION AND PROPHECY: THE CATHOLIC CHURCH IN SPAIN BY THE SWORD AND THE CROSS: THE HISTORICAL EVOLUTION OF THE CATHOLIC WORLD MONARCHY The titles reminded him of a dark tale Edmond had shared years ago after Langdon had commented that Edmond, for an American atheist, seemed to have an unusual obsession with Spain and Catholicism. "My mother was a native Spaniard," Edmond had replied flatly. "And a guilt-ridden Catholic." As Edmond shared the tragic tale of his childhood and his mother, Langdon could only listen with great surprise. Edmond's mother, Paloma Calvo, the computer scientist explained, had been the daughter of simple laborers in Cadiz, Spain. At nineteen, she fell in love with a university teacher from Chicago, Michael Kirsch, who was on sabbatical in Spain, and had become pregnant. Having witnessed the shunning of other unwed mothers in her strict Catholic community, Paloma saw no option but to accept the man's halfhearted offer to marry her and move to Chicago. Shortly after her son, Edmond, was born, Paloma's husband was struck by a car and killed while biking home from class. Castigo divino, her own father called it. Divine punishment. Paloma's parents refused to let their daughter return home to Cadiz and bring shame to their household. Instead, they warned that Paloma's dire circumstances were a clear sign of God's anger, and that the kingdom of heaven would never accept her unless she dedicated herself body and soul to Christ for the rest of her life. After giving birth to Edmond, Paloma worked as a maid in a motel and tried to raise him as best as she could. At night, in their meager apartment, she read Scripture and prayed for forgiveness, but her destitution only deepened, and with it, her certainty that God was not yet satisfied with her penance. Disgraced and fearful, Paloma became convinced after five years that the most profound act of maternal love she could show her child would be to give him a new life, one shielded from God's punishment of Paloma's sins. And so she placed five-year-old Edmond in an orphanage and returned to Spain, where she entered a convent. Edmond had never seen her again. When he was ten, Edmond learned that his mother had died in the convent during a self-imposed religious fast. Overcome with physical pain, she had hanged herself. "It's not a pleasant story," Edmond told Langdon. "As a high school student, I learned these details�and as you can imagine, my mother's unwavering zealotry has a lot to do with my abhorrence of religion. I call it��Newton's Third Law of Child Rearing: For every lunacy, there is an equal and opposite lunacy.'" After hearing the story, Langdon understood why Edmond had been so full of anger and bitterness when they met during Edmond's freshman year at Harvard. Langdon also marveled that Edmond had never once complained about the rigors of his childhood. Instead, he had declared himself fortunate for the early hardship because it had served as a potent motivation for Edmond to achieve his two childhood goals�first, to get out of poverty, and second, to help expose the hypocrisy of the faith he believed destroyed his mother. Success on both counts, Langdon thought sadly, continuing to peruse the apartment's library. As he began scanning a new section of bookshelves, he spotted many titles he recognized, most of them relevant to Edmond's lifelong concerns for the dangers of religion: THE GOD DELUSION GOD IS NOT GREAT THE PORTABLE ATHEIST LETTER TO A CHRISTIAN NATION THE END OF FAITH THE GOD VIRUS: HOW RELIGION INFECTS OUR LIVES AND CULTURE Over the last decade, books advocating rationality over blind faith had sprung up on nonfiction bestseller lists. Langdon had to admit that the cultural shift away from religion had become increasingly visible�even on the Harvard campus. Recently, the Washington Post had run an article on "godlessness at Harvard," reporting that for the first time in the school's 380-year history, the freshman class consisted of more agnostics and atheists than Protestants and Catholics combined. Similarly, across the Western world, antireligious organizations were sprouting up, pushing back against what they considered the dangers of religious dogma�American Atheists, the Freedom from Religion Foundation, Americanhumanist.org, the Atheist Alliance International. Langdon had never given these groups much thought until Edmond had told him about the Brights�a global organization that, despite its often misunderstood name, endorsed a naturalistic worldview with no supernatural or mystical elements. The Brights' membership included powerhouse intellectuals like Richard Dawkins, Margaret Downey, and Daniel Dennett. Apparently, the growing army of atheists was now packing some very big guns. Langdon had spotted books by both Dawkins and Dennett only minutes ago while skimming the section of the library devoted to evolution. The Dawkins classic The Blind Watchmaker forcefully challenged the teleological notion that human beings�much like complex watches�could exist only if they had a "designer." Similarly, one of Dennett's books, Darwin 's Dangerous Idea, argued that natural selection alone was sufficient to explain the evolution of life, and that complex biological designs could exist without help from a divine designer. God is not needed for life, Langdon mused, flashing on Edmond's presentation. The question "Where do we come from?" suddenly rang a bit more forcefully in Langdon's mind. Could that be part of Edmond's discovery? he wondered. The idea that life exists on its own�without a Creator? This notion, of course, stood in direct opposition to every major Creation story, which made Langdon increasingly curious to know if he might be on the right track. Then again, the idea seemed entirely unprovable. "Robert?" Ambra called behind him. Langdon turned to see that Ambra had completed searching her side of the library and was shaking her head. "Nothing over here," she said. "All nonfiction. I'll help you look on your side." "Same here so far," Langdon said. As Ambra crossed to Langdon's side of the library, Winston's voice crackled on the speakerphone. "Ms. Vidal?" Ambra raised Edmond's phone. "Yes?" "Both you and Professor Langdon need to see something right away," Winston said. "The palace has just made a public statement." Langdon moved quickly toward Ambra, standing close by her side, watching as the tiny screen in her hand began streaming a video. He recognized the plaza in front of Madrid's Royal Palace, where a uniformed man in handcuffs was being marched roughly into the frame by four Guardia Real agents. The agents turned their prisoner toward the camera, as if to disgrace him before the eyes of the world. "Garza?!" Ambra exclaimed, sounding stunned. "The head of the Guardia Real is under arrest?!" The camera turned now to show a woman in thick glasses who pulled a piece of paper out of a pocket of her pantsuit and prepared to read a statement. "That's Monica Martin," Ambra said. "Public relations coordinator. What is going on?" The woman began reading, enunciating every word clearly and distinctly. "The Royal Palace is hereby arresting Commander Diego Garza for his role in the murder of Edmond Kirsch, as well as his attempts to implicate Bishop Valdespino in that crime." Langdon could feel Ambra stagger slightly beside him as Monica Martin continued reading. "Regarding our future queen, Ambra Vidal," the PR coordinator said in an ominous tone, "and the American professor Robert Langdon, I'm afraid I have some deeply disturbing news." Langdon and Ambra exchanged a startled glance. "The palace has just received confirmation from Ms. Vidal's security detail," Martin continued, "that Ms. Vidal was taken from the Guggenheim Museum against her will tonight by Robert Langdon. Our Guardia Real are now on full alert, coordinating with local authorities in Barcelona, where it is believed that Robert Langdon is holding Ms. Vidal hostage." Langdon was speechless. "As this is now formally classified as a hostage situation, the public is urged to assist the authorities by reporting any and all information relating to the whereabouts of Ms. Vidal or Mr. Langdon. The palace has no further comment at this time." Reporters started screaming questions at Martin, who abruptly turned and marched off toward the palace. "This is ... madness," Ambra stammered. "My agents saw me leave the museum willingly!" Langdon stared at the phone, trying to make sense of what he had just witnessed. Despite the torrent of questions now swirling in his mind, he was entirely lucid about one key point. I am in serious danger. CHAPTER 56 "robert, I'M so sorry." Ambra Vidal's dark eyes were wild with fear and guilt. "I have no idea who is behind this false story, but they've just put you at enormous risk." The future queen of Spain reached for Edmond's phone. "I'm going to call Monica Martin right now." "Do not call Ms. Martin," Winston's voice chimed from the phone. "That is precisely what the palace wants. It's a ploy. They're trying to flush you out, trick you into making contact and revealing your location. Think logically. Your two Guardia agents know you were not kidnapped, and yet they've agreed to help spread this lie and fly to Barcelona to hunt you? Clearly, the entire palace is involved in this. And with the commander of the Royal Guard under arrest, these orders must be coming from higher up." Ambra drew a short breath. "Meaning ... Julian?" "An inescapable conclusion," Winston said. "The prince is the only one in the palace who has the authority to arrest Commander Garza." Ambra closed her eyes for a long moment, and Langdon sensed a wave of melancholy washing over her, as if this seemingly incontrovertible proof of Julian's involvement had just erased her last remaining hope that perhaps her fiance was an innocent bystander in all of this. "This is about Edmond's discovery," Langdon declared. "Someone in the palace knows we are trying to show Edmond's video to the world, and they're desperate to stop us." "Perhaps they thought their work was finished when they silenced Edmond," Winston added. "They didn't realize that there were loose ends." An uncomfortable silence hung between them. "Ambra," Langdon said quietly, "I obviously don't know your fiance, but I strongly suspect Bishop Valdespino has Julian's ear in this matter. Remember, Edmond and Valdespino were at odds before the museum event even started." She nodded, looking uncertain. "Either way, you're in danger." Suddenly they became aware of the faint sound of sirens wailing in the distance. Langdon felt his pulse quicken. "We need to find this poem now," he declared, resuming his search of the bookshelves. "Launching Edmond's presentation is the key to our safety. If we go public, then whoever is trying to silence us will realize they're too late." "True," Winston said, "but the local authorities will still be hunting for you as a kidnapper. You won't be safe unless you beat the palace at their own game." "How?" Ambra demanded. Winston continued without hesitation. "The palace used the media against you, but that's a knife that cuts both ways." Langdon and Ambra listened as Winston quickly outlined a very simple plan, one that Langdon had to admit would instantly create confusion and chaos among their assailants. "I'll do it," Ambra readily agreed. "Are you sure?" Langdon asked her warily. "There will be no going back for you." "Robert," she said, "I'm the one who got you into this, and now you're in danger. The palace had the gall to use the media as a weapon against you, and now I'm going to turn it around on them." "Fittingly so," Winston added. "Those who live by the sword will die by the sword." Langdon did a double take. Did Edmond's computer really just paraphrase Aeschylus? He wondered if it might not be more appropriate to quote Nietzsche: "Whoever fights monsters should see to it that in the process he does not become a monster." Before Langdon could protest any further, Ambra was moving down the hall, Edmond's phone in hand. "Find that password, Robert!" she called over her shoulder. "I'll be right back." Langdon watched her disappear into a narrow turret whose staircase spiraled up to Casa Mila's notoriously precarious rooftop deck. "Be careful!" he called after her. Alone now in Edmond's apartment, Langdon peered down the winding snake- rib hallway and tried to make sense of what he had seen here�cases of unusual artifacts, a framed quote proclaiming that God was dead, and a priceless Gauguin that posed the same questions Edmond had asked of the world earlier tonight. Where do we come from? Where are we going? He had found nothing yet that hinted at Edmond's possible answers to these questions. So far, Langdon's search of the library had yielded only one volume that seemed potentially relevant� Unexplained Art �a book of photographs of mysterious man-made structures, including Stonehenge, the Easter Island heads, and Nazca's sprawling "desert drawings"�geoglyphs drawn on such a massive scale that they were discernible only from the air. Not much help, he decided, and resumed his search of the shelves. Outside, the sirens grew louder. CHAPTER 57 "i am not a monster," Avila declared, exhaling as he relieved himself in a grungy urinal in a deserted rest stop on Highway N-240. At his side, the Uber driver was trembling, apparently too nervous to urinate. "You threatened ... my family." "And if you behave," Avila replied, "I assure you that no harm will come to them. Just take me to Barcelona, drop me off, and we will part as friends. I will return your wallet, forget your home address, and you need never think of me again." The driver stared straight ahead, his lips quivering. "You are a man of the faith," Avila said. "I saw the papal cross on your windshield. And no matter what you think of me, you can find peace in knowing that you are doing the work of God tonight." Avila finished at the urinal. "The Lord works in mysterious ways." Avila stepped back and checked the ceramic pistol tucked into his belt. It was loaded with his lone remaining bullet. He wondered if he'd need to use it tonight. He walked to the sink and ran water into his palms, seeing the tattoo that the Regent had directed him to place there in case he was caught. An unnecessary precaution, Avila suspected, now feeling like an untraceable spirit moving through the night. He raised his eyes to the filthy mirror, startled by his appearance. The last time Avila had seen himself, he was wearing full dress whites with a starched collar and a naval cap. Now, having stripped off the top of his uniform, he looked more like a trucker�wearing only his V-neck T-shirt and a baseball cap borrowed from his driver. Ironically, the disheveled man in the mirror reminded Avila of his appearance during his days of drunken self-loathing following the explosion that killed his family. I was in a bottomless pit. The turning point, he knew, had been the day when his physical therapist, Marco, had tricked him into driving out into the countryside to meet the "pope." Avila would never forget approaching the eerie spires of the Palmarian church, passing through their towering security gates, and entering the cathedral partway through the morning mass, where throngs of worshippers were kneeling in prayer. The sanctuary was lit only by natural light from high stained-glass windows, and the air smelled heavily of incense. When Avila saw the gilded altars and burnished wood pews, he realized that the rumors of the Palmarians' massive wealth were true. This church was as beautiful as any cathedral Avila had ever seen, and yet he knew that this Catholic church was unlike any other. The Palmarians are the sworn enemy of the Vatican. Standing with Marco at the rear of the cathedral, Avila gazed out over the congregation and wondered how this sect could have thrived after blatantly flaunting its opposition to Rome. Apparently, the Palmarians' denunciation of the Vatican's growing liberalism had struck a chord with believers who craved a more conservative interpretation of the faith. Hobbling up the aisle on his crutches, Avila felt like a miserable cripple making a pilgrimage to Lourdes in hopes of a miracle cure. An usher greeted Marco and led the two men to seats that had been cordoned off in the very front row. Nearby parishioners glanced over with curiosity to see who was getting this special treatment. Avila wished Marco had not convinced him to wear his decorated naval uniform. I thought I was meeting the pope. Avila sat down and raised his eyes to the main altar, where a young parishioner in a suit was doing a reading from a Bible. Avila recognized the passage�the Gospel of Mark. "�If you hold anything against anyone,"' the reader declared, �"forgive them, so that your Father in heaven may forgive you your sins.'" More forgiveness? Avila thought, scowling. He felt like he'd heard this passage a thousand times from the grief counselors and nuns in the months after the terrorist attack. The reading ended, and the swelling chords of a pipe organ resounded in the sanctuary. The congregants rose in unison, and Avila reluctantly clambered to his feet, wincing in pain. A hidden door behind the altar opened and a figure appeared, sending a ripple of excitement through the crowd. The man looked to be in his fifties�upright and regal with a graceful stature and a compelling gaze. He wore a white cassock, a golden tippet, an embroidered sash, and a bejeweled papal predosa miter. He advanced with his arms outstretched to the congregation, seeming to hover as he moved toward the center of the altar. "There he is," Marco whispered excitedly. "Pope Innocent the Fourteenth." He calls himself Pope Innocent XIV? The Palmarians, Avila knew, recognized the legitimacy of every pope up to Paul VI, who died in 1978. "We're just in time," Marco said. "He's about to deliver his homily." The pope moved toward the center of the raised altar, bypassing the formal pulpit and stepping down so that he stood at the same level as his parishioners. He adjusted his lavalier microphone, held out his hands, and smiled warmly. "Good morning," he intoned in a whisper. The congregation boomed in response. "Good morning /" The pope continued moving away from the altar, closer to his congregation. "We have just heard a reading from the Gospel of Mark," he began, "a passage I chose personally because this morning I would like to talk about forgiveness ." The pope drifted over to Avila and stopped in the aisle beside him, only inches away. He never once looked down. Avila glanced uneasily at Marco, who gave him an excited nod. "We all struggle with forgiveness," the pope said to the congregation. "And that is because there are times when the trespasses against us seem to be unforgivable. When someone kills innocent people in an act of pure hatred, should we do as some churches will teach us, and turn the other cheek?" The room fell deathly silent, and the pope lowered his voice even further. "When an anti-Christian extremist sets off a bomb during morning mass in the Cathedral of Seville, and that bomb kills innocent mothers and children, how can we be expected to forgive ? Bombing is an act of war. A war not just against Catholics. A war not just against Christians. But a war against goodness ... against God Himself!" Avila closed his eyes, trying to repress the horrific memories of that morning, and all the rage and misery still churning in his heart. As his anger swelled, Avila suddenly felt the pope's gentle hand on his shoulder. Avila opened his eyes, but the pope never looked down at him. Even so, the man's touch felt steady and reassuring. "Let us not forget our own Terror Rojo," the pope continued, his hand never leaving Avila's shoulder. "During our civil war, enemies of God burned Spain's churches and monasteries, murdering more than six thousand priests and torturing hundreds of nuns, forcing the sisters to swallow their rosary beads before violating them and throwing them down mineshafts to their deaths." He paused and let his words sink in. "That kind of hatred does not disappear over time; instead, it festers, growing stronger, waiting to rise up again like a cancer. My friends, I warn you, evil will swallow us whole if we do not fight force with force. We will never conquer evil if our battle cry is 'forgiveness.'" He is correct, Avila thought, having witnessed firsthand in the military that being "soft" on misconduct was the best way to guarantee increasing misconduct. "I believe," the pope continued, "that in some cases forgiveness can be dangerous. When we forgive evil in the world, we are giving evil permission to grow and spread. When we respond to an act of war with an act of mercy, we are encouraging our enemies to commit further acts of violence. There comes a time when we must do as Jesus did and forcefully throw over the money tables, shouting: �This will not stand!'" I agree! Avila wanted to shout as the congregation nodded its approval. "But do we take action?" the pope asked. "Does the Catholic Church in Rome make a stand like Jesus did? No, it doesn't. Today we face the darkest evils in the world with nothing more than our ability to forgive, to love, and to be compassionate. And so we allow�no, we encourage �the evil to grow. In response to repeated crimes against us, we delicately voice our concerns in politically correct language, reminding each other that an evil person is evil only because of his difficult childhood, or his impoverished life, or his having suffered crimes against his own loved ones�and so his hatred is not his own fault. I say, enough! Evil is evil! We have all struggled in life!" The congregation broke into spontaneous applause, something Avila had never witnessed during a Catholic service. "I chose to speak about forgiveness today," the pope continued, his hand still on Avila's shoulder, "because we have a special guest in our midst. I would like to thank Admiral Luis Avila for blessing us with his presence. He is a revered and decorated member of Spain's military, and he has faced unthinkable evil. Like all of us, he has struggled with forgiveness." Before Avila could protest, the pope was recounting in vivid detail the struggles of Avila's life�the loss of his family in a terrorist attack, his descent into alcoholism, and finally his failed suicide attempt. Avila's initial reaction was anger with Marco for betraying a trust, and yet now, hearing his own story told in this way, he felt strangely empowered. It was a public admission that he had hit rock bottom, and somehow, perhaps miraculously, he had survived. "I would suggest to all of you," the pope said, "that God intervened in Admiral Avila's life, and saved him ... for a higher purpose." With that, the Palmarian pope Innocent XIV turned and gazed down at Avila for the first time. The man's deep-set eyes seemed to penetrate Avila's soul, and he felt electrified with a kind of strength he had not felt in years. "Admiral Avila," the pope declared, "I believe that the tragic loss you have endured is beyond forgiveness. I believe your ongoing rage�your righteous desire for vengeance�cannot be quelled by turning the other cheek. Nor should it be! Your pain will be the catalyst for your own salvation. We are here to support you! To love you! To stand by your side and help transform your anger into a potent force for goodness in the world! Praise be to God!" "Praise be to God!" the congregation echoed. "Admiral Avila," the pope continued, staring even more intently into his eyes. "What is the motto of the Spanish Armada?" "Pro Deo et patria," Avila replied immediately. "Yes, Pro Deo et patria. For God and country. We are all honored to be in the presence today of a decorated naval officer who has served his country so well." The pope paused, leaning forward. "But ... what about God?" Avila gazed up into the man's piercing eyes and felt suddenly off balance. "Your life is not over, Admiral," the pope whispered. "Your work is not done. This is why God saved you. Your sworn mission is only half complete. You have served country, yes ... but you have not yet served God!" Avila felt like he had been struck by a bullet. "Peace be with you!" the pope proclaimed. "And also with you!" the congregation responded. Avila suddenly found himself swallowed up by a sea of well-wishers in an outpouring of support unlike anything he'd ever experienced. He searched the parishioners' eyes for any trace of the cultlike fanaticism he had feared, but all he saw was optimism, goodwill, and a sincere passion for doing God's work ... exactly what Avila realized he had been lacking. From that day on, with the help of Marco and his new group of friends, Avila began his long climb out of the bottomless pit of despair. He returned to his rigorous exercise routine, ate nutritious foods, and, most important, rediscovered his faith. After several months, when his physical therapy was complete, Marco presented Avila with a leather-bound Bible in which he had flagged a dozen or so passages. Avila flipped to a few of them at random. ROMANS 13:4 For he is a servant of God � the avenger who carries out God's wrath on wrongdoers. PSALM 94:1 O Lord, the God of vengeance, let your glorious justice shine forth! 2 TIMOTHY 2:3 Share in suffering, as a good soldier of Christ Jesus. "Remember," Marco had told him with a smile. "When evil rears its head in the world, God works through each of us in a different way, to exert His will on earth. Forgiveness is not the only path to salvation."

Outside, the two-tone police sirens had grown louder and louder before abruptly stopping directly in front of Casa Mila. Through the apartment's tiny portal windows, Langdon could see the flash of spinning police lights. We 're trapped in here, he realized. We need that forty-seven-letter password, or there will be no way out. Unfortunately, Langdon had yet to see a single book of poems. The shelves in the final section were deeper than the rest and appeared to hold Edmond's collection of large-format art books. As Langdon hurried along the wall, scanning the titles, he saw books that reflected Edmond's passion for the hippest and newest in contemporary art. Serra ... Koons ... Hirst ... Bruguera ... Basquiat ... Banksy ... Abramovic ... The collection stopped abruptly at a series of smaller volumes, and Langdon paused in hopes of finding a book on poetry. Nothing. The books here were commentaries and critiques of abstract art, and Langdon spotted a few titles that Edmond had sent for him to peruse. WHAT ARE YOU LOOKING AT? WHY YOUR FIVE-YEAR-OLD COULD NOT HAVE DONE THAT HOW TO SURVIVE MODERN ART I'm still trying to survive it, Langdon thought, quickly moving on. He stepped around another rib and started sifting through the next section. Modern art books, he mused. Even at a glance, Langdon could see that this group was dedicated to an earlier period. At least we 're moving back in time ... toward art I understand. Langdon's eyes moved quickly along the book spines, taking in biographies and catalogues raisonnes of the Impressionists, Cubists, and Surrealists who had stunned the world between 1870 and 1960 by entirely redefining art. Van Gogh ... Seurat ... Picasso ... Munch ... Matisse ... Magritte ... Klimt ... Kandinsky ... Johns ... Hockney ... Gauguin ... Duchamp ... Degas ... Chagall ... Cezanne ... Cassatt ... Braque ... Arp ... Albers ... This section terminated at one last architectural rib, and Langdon moved past it, finding himself in the final section of the library. The volumes here appeared to be dedicated to the group of artists that Edmond, in Langdon's presence, liked to call "the school of boring dead white guys"�essentially, anything predating the modernist movement of the mid-nineteenth century. Unlike Edmond, it was here that Langdon felt most at home, surrounded by the Old Masters. Vermeer ... VelAzquez ... Titian ... Tintoretto ... Rubens ... Rembrandt ... Raphael ... Poussin ... Michelangelo ... Lippi ... Goya ... Giotto ... Ghirlandaio ... El Greco ... DUrer ... Da Vinci ... Corot ... Caravaggio ... Botticelli ... Bosch ... The last few feet of the final shelf were dominated by a large glass cabinet, sealed with a heavy lock. Langdon peered through the glass and saw an ancient� looking leather box inside�a protective casing for a massive antique book. The text on the outside of the box was barely legible, but Langdon could see enough to decrypt the title of the volume inside. My God, he thought, now realizing why this book had been locked away from the hands of visitors. It's probably worth a fortune. Langdon knew there were precious few early editions of this legendary artist's work in existence. I'm not surprised Edmond invested in this, he thought, recalling that Edmond had once referred to this British artist as "the only premodern with any imagination." Langdon disagreed, but he could certainly understand Edmond's special affection for this artist. They are both cut from the same cloth. Langdon crouched down and peered through the glass at the box's gilded engraving: The Complete Works of William Blake. William Blake, Langdon mused. The Edmond Kirsch of the eighteen hundreds. Blake had been an idiosyncratic genius�a prolific luminary whose painting style was so progressive that some believed he had magically glimpsed the future in his dreams. His symbol-infused religious illustrations depicted angels, demons, Satan, God, mythical creatures, biblical themes, and a pantheon of deities from his own spiritual hallucinations. And just like Kirsch, Blake loved to challenge Christianity. The thought caused Langdon to stand up abruptly. William Blake. He drew a startled breath. Finding Blake among so many other visual artists had caused Langdon to forget one crucial fact about the mystical genius. Blake was not only an artist and illustrator ... Blake was a prolific poet. For an instant, Langdon felt his heart begin to race. Much of Blake's poetry espoused revolutionary ideas that meshed perfectly with Edmond's views. In fact, some of Blake's most widely known aphorisms�those in "satanic" works like The Marriage of Heaven and Hell �could almost have been written by Edmond himself. ALL RELIGIONS ARE ONE THERE IS NO NATURAL RELIGION Langdon now recalled Edmond's description of his favorite line of poetry. He told Ambra it was a "prophecy. " Langdon knew of no poet in history who could be considered more of a prophet than William Blake, who, in the 1790s, had penned two dark and ominous poems: AMERICA A PROPHECY EUROPE A PROPHECY Langdon owned both works�elegant reproductions of Blake's handwritten poems and accompanying illustrations. Langdon peered at the large leather box inside the cabinet. The original editions of Blake's "prophecies" would have been published as large-format illuminated texts! With a surge of hope, Langdon crouched down in front of the cabinet, sensing the leather box might very well contain what he and Ambra had come here to find�a poem that contained a prophetic forty-seven-character line. The only question now was whether Edmond had somehow marked his favorite passage. Langdon reached out and pulled the cabinet handle. Locked. He glanced toward the spiral staircase, wondering whether he should simply dash upstairs and ask Winston to run a search on all of William Blake's poetry. The sound of sirens had been replaced by the distant thrum of helicopter blades and voices yelling in the stairwell outside Edmond's door. They're here. Langdon eyed the cabinet and noted the faint greenish tint of modern museum-grade UV glass. He whipped off his jacket, held it over the glass, turned his body, and without hesitation, rammed his elbow into the pane. With a muffled crunch, the cabinet door shattered. Carefully, Langdon reached through the jagged shards, unlocking the door. Then he swung the door open and gently lifted out the leather box. Even before Langdon set the box on the floor, he could tell that something was wrong. It's not heavy enough. Blake's complete works seemed to weigh almost nothing. Langdon set down the box and carefully raised the lid. Just as he feared ... empty. He exhaled, staring into the vacant container. Where the hell is Edmond's book?! He was about to close the box when Langdon noticed something unexpected taped to the inside of the lid�an elegantly embossed ivory note card. Langdon read the text on the card. Then, in utter disbelief, he read it again. Seconds later, he was racing up the spiral staircase toward the roof. At that instant, on the second floor of Madrid's Royal Palace, director of electronic security Suresh Bhalla was moving quietly through Prince Julian's private apartment. After locating the digital wall safe, he entered the master override code that was kept for emergencies. The safe popped open. Inside, Suresh saw two phones�a secure palace-issued smartphone that belonged to Prince Julian and an iPhone that, he deduced, in all likelihood was the property of Bishop Valdespino. He grabbed the iPhone. Am I really doing this? Again he pictured the message from monte@iglesia.org. i hacked valdespino's texts. he has dangerous secrets. the palace should access his sms records. now. Suresh wondered what secrets the bishop's texts could possibly reveal ... and why the informant had decided to give the Royal Palace a heads-up. Perhaps the informant is trying to protect the palace from collateral damage? All Suresh knew was that if there was information that was of danger to the royal family, it was his job to access it. He had already considered obtaining an emergency subpoena, but the PR risks and the delay made it impractical. Fortunately, Suresh had far more discreet and expedient methods at his disposal. Holding Valdespino's phone, he pressed the home button and the screen lit up. Locked with a password. No problem. "Hey, Siri," Suresh said, holding the phone to his mouth. "What time is it?" Still in locked mode, the phone displayed a clock. On this clock screen, Suresh ran through a series of simple commands�creating a new time zone for the clock, asking to share the time zone via SMS, adding a photo, and then, rather than trying to send the text, hitting the home button. Click. The phone unlocked. This simple hack compliments of YouTube, Suresh thought, amused that iPhone users believed their password offered them any privacy at all. Now, with full access to Valdespino's phone, Suresh opened the Message app, fully anticipating that he would have to restore Valdespino's deleted texts by tricking the iCloud backup into rebuilding the catalog. Sure enough, he found the bishop's text history entirely empty. Except for one message, he realized, seeing a lone inbound text that had arrived a couple of hours ago from a blocked number. Suresh clicked open the text and read the three-line message. For a moment, he thought he was hallucinating. This can't be true! Suresh read the message again. The text was absolute proof of Valdespino's involvement in acts of unthinkable treachery and deceit. Not to mention arrogance, Suresh thought, stunned that the old cleric would feel so invulnerable as to communicate a message like this electronically. If this text goes public ... Suresh shuddered at the possibility and immediately ran downstairs to find Monica Martin. CHAPTER 60 as the ec 145 helicopter streaked in low over the city, Agent Diaz stared down at the sprawl of lights beneath him. Despite the late hour, he could see the flicker of televisions and computers in the majority of apartment windows, painting the city with a faint blue haze. The whole world is watching. It made him nervous. He could feel this night spiraling wildly out of control, and he feared this growing crisis was headed for a disturbing conclusion. In front of him, Agent Fonseca shouted and pointed into the distance directly ahead. Diaz nodded, spotting their target at once. Hard to miss. Even from a distance, the pulsating cluster of spinning blue police lights was unmistakable. God help us. Just as Diaz had feared, Casa Mila was overrun by local police cars. The Barcelona authorities had responded to an anonymous tip on the heels of Monica Martin's press announcement from the Royal Palace. Robert Lang don has kidnapped the future queen of Spain. The palace needs the public's help in finding them. A blatant lie, Diaz knew. With my own eyes I saw them leave the Guggenheim together. While Martin's ploy had been effective, it had set in motion an incredibly dangerous game. Creating a public manhunt by involving local authorities was perilous�not just for Robert Langdon, but for the future queen, who now had a very good chance of being caught in the cross fire of a bunch of amateur local cops. If the palace's goal was to keep the future queen safe, this was definitely not the way to do it. Commander Garza would never have permitted this situation to escalate so far. Garza's arrest remained a mystery to Diaz, who had no doubt that the charges against his commander were just as fictitious as those against Langdon. Nonetheless, Fonseca had taken the call and received his orders. Orders from above Garza's head. As the helicopter neared Casa Mila, Agent Diaz surveyed the scene below and realized there would be no safe place to land. The broad avenue and corner plaza in front of the building were packed with media trucks, police cars, and crowds of onlookers. Diaz looked down at the building's famous rooftop�an undulating figure eight of sloping pathways and staircases that wound above the building and provided visitors with breathtaking views of the Barcelona skyline ... as well as views down into the building's two gaping light wells, each of which dropped nine stories to interior courtyards. No landing there. In addition to the heaving hills and valleys of the terrain, the roof deck was protected by towering Gaudi chimneys that resembled futuristic chess pieces� helmeted sentinels that allegedly had so impressed film-maker George Lucas that he'd used them as models for his menacing storm troopers in Star Wars. Diaz glanced away to scan the neighboring buildings for possible landing sites, but his gaze suddenly stopped on an unexpected vision atop Casa Mila. A small figure stood among the huge statues. Poised at a railing near the edge of the roof, the person was dressed in white, starkly illuminated by the upward-facing media lights in the plaza below. For an instant, the vision reminded Diaz of seeing the pope on his balcony over St. Peter's Square, addressing his followers. But this was not the pope. This was a beautiful woman in a very familiar white dress. Ambra Vidal could see nothing through the glare of the media lights, but she could hear a helicopter closing in and knew time was running out. Desperately, she leaned out over the railing and attempted to shout to the swarm of media people below. Her words vanished into the deafening roar of helicopter rotors. Winston had predicted that the television crews on the street would direct their cameras upward the instant Ambra was spotted on the edge of the roof. Indeed, that was exactly what had happened, and yet Ambra knew Winston's plan had failed. They can't hear a word I'm saying! The rooftop of Casa Mila stood too high over the blaring traffic and chaos below. And now the thrum of the helicopter threatened to drown out everything entirely. "I have not been kidnapped!" Ambra yelled once again, mustering as much volume as she could. "The statement from the Royal Palace about Robert Langdon was inaccurate! I am not a hostage!" You are the future queen of Spain, Winston had reminded her moments earlier. If you call off this manhunt, the authorities will stop dead in their tracks. Your statement will create utter confusion. Nobody will know which orders to follow. Ambra knew Winston was right, but her words had been lost in the rotor wash above the boisterous crowd. Suddenly the sky erupted in a thunderous howl. Ambra recoiled back from the railing as the helicopter swooped closer and halted abruptly, hovering directly in front of her. The fuselage doors were wide open, and two familiar faces stared intently out at her�Agents Fonseca and Diaz. To Ambra's horror, Agent Fonseca raised some kind of device, which he aimed directly at her head. For a moment, the strangest of thoughts raced through her mind. Julian wants me dead. I am a barren woman. I cannot give him an heir. Killing me is his only escape from this engagement. Ambra staggered back, away from the threatening-looking device, clutching Edmond's cell phone in one hand and reaching out for balance with the other. But as she placed her foot behind her, the ground seemed to disappear. For an instant, she felt only empty space where she had expected solid cement. Her body twisted as she tried to regain her balance, but she felt herself pitching sidelong down a short flight of stairs. Her left elbow smashed into the cement, and the rest of her crashed down an instant later. Even so, Ambra Vidal felt no pain. Her entire focus shifted to the object that had flown out of her hand�Edmond's oversized turquoise cell phone. My God, no! She watched with dread as the phone skittered across the cement, bouncing down the stairs toward the edge of the nine-story drop to the building's inner courtyard. She lunged for the phone, but it disappeared under the protective fencing, tumbling into the abyss. Our connection to Winston ...! Ambra scrambled after it, arriving at the fence just in time to see Edmond's phone tumbling end over end toward the lobby's elegant stone floor, where, with a sharp crack, it exploded in a shower of shimmering glass and metal. In an instant, Winston was gone. Bounding up the steps, Langdon burst out of the stairwell turret onto the Casa Mila roof deck. He found himself in the middle of a deafening maelstrom. A helicopter was hovering very low beside the building, and Ambra was nowhere to be seen. Dazed, Langdon scanned the area. Where is she? He had forgotten how bizarre this rooftop was�lopsided parapets ... steep staircases ... cement soldiers ... bottomless pits. "Ambra!" When he spotted her, he felt a surge of dread. Ambra Vidal was lying crumpled on the cement at the edge of the light well. As Langdon raced up and over a rise toward her, the sharp zing of a bullet whipped past his head and exploded in the cement behind him. Jesus! Langdon dropped to his knees and scrambled toward lower ground as two more bullets sailed over his head. For a moment, he thought the shots were coming from the helicopter, but as he clambered toward Ambra, he saw a swarm of police flooding out of another turret on the far side of the rooftop with their guns drawn. They want to kill me, he realized. They think I kidnapped the future queen! Her rooftop announcement apparently had gone unheard. As Langdon looked toward Ambra, now only ten yards away, he realized to his horror that her arm was bleeding. My God, she's been shot! Another bullet sailed over his head as Ambra began clawing at the railing that encircled the drop-off to the inner courtyard. She struggled to pull herself up. "Stay down!" Langdon shouted, scrambling to Ambra and crouching protectively over her body. He looked up at the towering, helmeted storm- trooper figures that dotted the rooftop's perimeter like silent guardians. There was a deafening roar overhead, and buffeting winds whipped around them as the helicopter dropped down and hovered over the enormous shaft beside them, cutting off the police's line of sight. "jDejen de disparar!" boomed an amplified voice from the chopper. "jEnfunden las armas!" Stop shooting! Holster your weapons! Directly in front of Langdon and Ambra, Agent Diaz was crouched in the open bay door with one foot balanced on the skid and one hand outstretched toward them. "Get in!" he shouted. Langdon felt Ambra recoil beneath him. "NOW!" Diaz screamed over the deafening rotors. The agent pointed to the light well's safety railing, urging them to climb onto it, grab his hand, and make the short leap over the abyss into the hovering aircraft. Langdon hesitated an instant too long. Diaz grabbed the bullhorn from Fonseca and aimed it directly at Langdon's face. "PROFESSOR, GET IN THE HELICOPTER NOW!" The agent's voice boomed like thunder. "THE LOCAL POLICE HAVE ORDERS TO SHOOT YOU! WE KNOW YOU DID NOT KIDNAP MS. VIDAL! I NEED YOU BOTH ON BOARD IMMEDIATELY�BEFORE SOMEONE GETS KILLED!" CHAPTER 61 in the howling wind, Ambra felt Langdon's arms lifting her up and guiding her toward Agent Diaz's outstretched hand in the hovering chopper. She was too dazed to protest. "She's bleeding!" Langdon shouted as he clambered into the aircraft after her. Suddenly the helicopter was lifting skyward, away from the undulating rooftop, leaving behind a small army of confused policemen, ah staring upward. Fonseca heaved the fuselage door shut and then moved up front toward the pilot. Diaz slid in beside Ambra to examine her arm. "It's only a scrape," she said blankly. "I'll find a first-aid kit." Diaz headed to the rear of the cabin. Langdon was seated opposite Ambra, facing backward. Now that the two of them were suddenly alone, he caught her eye and gave her a relieved smile. "I'm so glad you're okay." Ambra replied with a weak nod, but before she could thank him, Langdon was leaning forward in his seat, whispering to her in an excited tone. "I think I found our mysterious poet," he exclaimed, his eyes filled with hope. "William Blake. Not only is there a copy of Blake's complete works in Edmond's library ... but many of Blake's poems are prophecies'." Langdon held out his hand. "Let me have Edmond's phone�I'll ask Winston to search Blake's work for any forty-seven-letter lines of poetry!" Ambra looked at Langdon's waiting palm and felt overcome with guilt. She reached out and took his hand in hers. "Robert," she said with a remorseful sigh, "Edmond's phone is gone. It fell off the edge of the building." Langdon stared back at her, and Ambra saw the blood drain from his face. I'm so sorry, Robert. She could see him struggling to process the news and figure out where the loss of Winston now left them. In the cockpit, Fonseca was yelling into his phone. "Confirmed! We have both of them safely aboard. Prepare the transport plane for Madrid. I will contact the palace and alert�" "Don't bother!" Ambra shouted to the agent. "I am not going to the palace!" Fonseca covered his phone, turned in his seat, and looked back at her. "You most certainly are! My orders tonight were to keep you safe. You should never have left my custody. You're lucky I was able to get here to rescue you." "Rescue?!" Ambra demanded. "If that was a rescue, it was only necessary because the palace told ridiculous lies about Professor Langdon kidnappingme� which you know is not true! Is Prince Julian really so desperate that he's willing to risk the life of an innocent man? Not to mention my life?" Fonseca stared her down and turned back around in his seat. Just then, Diaz returned with the first-aid kit. "Ms. Vidal," he said, taking a seat beside her. "Please understand that our chain of command has been disrupted tonight due to the arrest of Commander Garza. Nonetheless, I want you to know that Prince Julian had nothing to do with the media statement that came out of the palace. In fact, we cannot even confirm that the prince knows what's happening right now. We have been unable to reach him for over an hour." What? Ambra stared at him. "Where is he?" "His current whereabouts are unknown," Diaz said, "but his communication with us earlier this evening was crystal clear. The prince wants you safe." "If that's true," Langdon declared, abruptly returning from his thoughts, "then taking Ms. Vidal to the palace is a deadly mistake." Fonseca spun around. "What did you say?!" "I don't know who is giving you orders now, sir," Langdon said, "but if the prince truly wants to keep his fiancee safe, then I suggest you listen to me very carefully." He paused, his tone intensifying. "Edmond Kirsch was murdered to keep his discovery from going public. And whoever silenced him will stop at nothing to make sure that job is finished." "It's finished already," Fonseca scoffed. "Edmond is dead." "But his discovery is not," Langdon replied. "Edmond's presentation is very much alive and can still be released to the world." "Which is why you came to his apartment," Diaz ventured. "Because you believe you can launch it." "Precisely," Langdon replied. "And that has made us targets. I don't know who manufactured the media statement claiming Ambra was kidnapped, but it was clearly someone desperate to stop us. So if you are part of that group�the people trying to bury Edmond's discovery forever�then you should simply toss Ms. Vidal and myself out of this helicopter right now while you still can." Ambra stared at Langdon, wondering if he'd lost his mind. "However," Langdon continued, "if your sworn duty as a Guardia Real agent is to protect the royal family, including the future queen of Spain, then you need to realize there is no more dangerous place for Ms. Vidal right now than a palace that just issued a public statement that almost got her killed." Langdon reached into his pocket and extracted an elegantly embossed linen note card. "I suggest you take her to the address at the bottom of this card." Fonseca took the card and studied it, his brow furrowing. "That's ridiculous." "There is a security fence around the entire property," Langdon said. "Your pilot can touch down, drop the four of us off, and then fly away before anyone realizes we're even there. I know the person in charge. We can hide there, off the grid, until we sort this all out. You can accompany us." "I'd feel safer in a military hangar at the airport." "Do you really want to trust a military team that is probably taking orders from the same people who just nearly got Ms. Vidal killed?" Fonseca's stony expression never wavered. Ambra's thoughts were racing wildly now, and she wondered what was written on the card. Where does Langdon want to go? His sudden intensity seemed to imply there was more at stake than simply keeping her safe. She heard a renewed optimism in his voice and sensed he had not yet given up hope that they could somehow still launch Edmond's presentation. Langdon retrieved the linen card from Fonseca and handed it to Ambra. "I found this in Edmond's library." Ambra studied the card, immediately recognizing what it was. Known as "loan logs" or "title cards," these elegantly embossed placeholders were given by museum curators to donors in exchange for a piece of artwork on temporary loan. Traditionally, two identical cards were printed�one placed on display in the museum to thank the donor, and one held by the donor as collateral for the piece he had loaned. Edmond loaned out his book of Blake's poetry? According to the card, Edmond's book had traveled no more than a few kilometers away from his Barcelona apartment. THE COMPLETE WORKS OF WILLIAM BLAKE From the private collection of EDMOND KIRSCH On loan to LA BASILICA DE LA SAGRADA FAMILIA Carrer de Mallorca, 401 08013 Barcelona, Spain "I don't understand," Ambra said. "Why would an outspoken atheist lend a book to a church ?" "Not just any church," Langdon countered. "Gaudi's most enigmatic architectural masterpiece ..." He pointed out the window, into the distance behind them. "And soon to be the tallest church in Europe." Ambra turned her head, peering back across the city to the north. In the distance�surrounded by cranes, scaffolding, and construction lights�the unfinished towers of Sagrada Familia shone brightly, a cluster of perforated spires that resembled giant sea sponges climbing off the ocean floor toward the light. For more than a century, Gaudi's controversial Basilica de la Sagrada Familia had been under construction, relying solely on private donations from the faithful. Criticized by traditionalists for its eerie organic shape and use of "biomimetic design," the church was hailed by modernists for its structural fluidity and use of "hyperboloid" forms to reflect the natural world. "I'll admit it's unusual," Ambra said, turning back to Fangdon, "but it's still a Catholic church. And you know Edmond." I do know Edmond, Fangdon thought. Enough to know he believes Sagrada Familia hides a secret purpose and symbolism that go far beyond Christianity. Since the bizarre church's groundbreaking in 1882, conspiracy theories had swirled about its mysteriously encoded doors, cosmically inspired helicoid columns, symbol-laden facades, magic-square mathematical carvings, and ghostly "skeletal" construction that clearly resembled twisting bones and connective tissue. Fangdon was aware of the theories, of course, and yet never gave them much credence. A few years back, however, Fangdon was surprised when Edmond confessed that he was one of a growing number of Gaudi fans who quietly believed that Sagrada Familia was secretly conceived as something other than a Christian church, perhaps even as a mystical shrine to science and nature. Fangdon found the notion highly unlikely, and he reminded Edmond that Gaudi was a devout Catholic whom the Vatican had held in such high esteem that they christened him "God's architect," and even considered him for beatification. Sagrada Familia's unusual design, Fangdon assured Kirsch, was nothing more than an example of Gaudi's unique modernist approach to Christian symbolism. Edmond's reply was a coy smile, as if he were secretly holding some mysterious piece of the puzzle that he was not ready to share. Another Kirsch secret, Langdon now thought. Like his hidden battle with cancer. "Even if Edmond did loan his book to Sagrada Familia," Ambra continued, "and even if we find it, we will never be able to locate the correct line by reading it page by page. And I really doubt Edmond used a highlighter on a priceless manuscript." "Ambra?" Langdon replied with a calm smile. "Look at the back of the card." She glanced down at the card, flipped it over, and read the text on the back. Then, with a look of disbelief, Ambra read it again. When her eyes snapped back up to Langdon's, they were filled with hope. "As I was saying," Langdon said with a smile, "I think we should go there." Ambra's excited expression faded as quickly as it came. "There is still a problem. Even if we find his password�" "I know�we lost Edmond's phone, meaning we have no way to access Winston and communicate with him." "Exactly." "I believe I can solve that problem." Ambra eyed him skeptically. "I'm sorry?" "All we need is to locate Winston himself �the actual computer that Edmond built. If we no longer have access to Winston remotely, we'll just have to take the password to Winston in person." Ambra stared at him as if he were mad. Langdon continued. "You told me Edmond built Winston in a secret facility." "Yes, but that facility could be anywhere in the world!" "It's not. It's here in Barcelona. It has to be. Barcelona is the city where Edmond lived and worked. And building this synthetic intelligence machine was one of his most recent projects, so it only makes sense that Edmond would have built Winston here." "Robert, even if you're right, you're looking for a needle in a haystack. Barcelona is an enormous city. It would be impossible�" "I can find Winston," Langdon said. "I'm sure of it." He smiled and motioned to the sprawl of city lights beneath them. "This will sound crazy, but seeing this aerial view of Barcelona just now helped me realize something ..." His voice trailed off as he looked out the window. "Would you care to elaborate?" Ambra asked expectantly. "I should have seen it earlier," he said. "There's something about Winston� an intriguing puzzle�that has been bothering me all night. I think I finally figured it out." Langdon shot a cautious glance at the Guardia agents and then lowered his voice, leaning toward Ambra. "Will you just trust me on this?" he asked quietly. "I believe I can find Winston. The problem is that finding Winston will do us no good without Edmond's password. Right now, you and I need to focus on finding that line of poetry. Sagrada Familia is our best chance of doing that." Ambra studied Langdon a long moment. Then, with a bewildered nod, she looked toward the front seat and called, "Agent Fonseca! Please have the pilot turn around and take us to Sagrada Familia right away!" Fonseca spun in his seat, glaring at her. "Ms. Vidal, as I told you, I have my orders�" "Agent Fonseca," interrupted the future queen of Spain, leaning forward and locking eyes with him. "Take us to Sagrada Familia, right now, or my first order of business when we return will be to have you fired." CHAPTER 62 ConspiracyNet.com BREAKING NEWS ASSASSIN CULT CONNECTION! Thanks to yet another tip from monte@iglesia.org, we have just learned that Edmond Kirsch's killer is a member of an ultraconservative, secretive Christian sect known as the Palmarian Church'. Lufs Avila has been recruiting online for the Palmarians for more than a year now, and his membership in this controversial religio-military organization also explains the "victor" tattoo on his palm. This Francoist symbol is in regular use by the Palmarian Church, which, according to Spain's national newspaper, El Pais, has its own "pope" and has canonized several ruthless leaders� including Francisco Franco and Adolf Hitler�as saints! Don't believe us? Look it up. It all began with a mystical vision. In 1975, an insurance broker named Clemente Dominguez y Gomez claimed to have had a vision in which he was crowned pope by Jesus Christ Himself. Clemente took the papal name Gregory XVII, breaking from the Vatican and appointing his own cardinals. Although rejected by Rome, this new antipope amassed thousands of followers and vast wealth enabling him to construct a fortresslike church, expand his ministry internationally, and consecrate hundreds of Palmarian bishops worldwide. The schismatic Palmarian Church still functions today out of its world headquarters�a secure, walled compound called the Mount of Christ the King in El Palmar de Troya, Spain. The Palmarians are not recognized by the Vatican in Rome, and yet continue to attract an ultraconservative Catholic following. More news on this sect soon, as well as an update on Bishop Antonio Valdespino, who also seems to be implicated in tonight's conspiracy. CHAPTER 63 okay, I'M impressed, Langdon thought. With a few strong words, Ambra had just forced the crew of the EC145 helicopter to make a wide-banking turn and redirect toward the Basilica of the Sagrada Familia. As the aircraft leveled out and began skimming back across the city, Ambra turned to Agent Diaz and demanded the use of his cell phone, which the Guardia agent reluctantly handed over. Ambra promptly launched his browser and began scanning news headlines. "Damn," she whispered, shaking her head with frustration. "I tried to tell the media you did not kidnap me. Nobody could hear me." "Maybe they need more time to post?" Langdon offered. This happened less than ten minutes ago. "They've had enough time," she replied. "I'm seeing video clips of our helicopter speeding away from Casa Mila." Already? Langdon sometimes felt that the world had begun to spin too quickly on its axis. He could still recall when "breaking news" was printed on paper and delivered to his doorstep the following morning. "By the way," Ambra said with a trace of humor, "it appears you and I are one of the world's top-trending news stories." "I knew I shouldn't have kidnapped you," he replied wryly. "Not funny. At least we're not the number one story." She handed him the phone. "Have a look at this." Langdon eyed the screen and saw the Yahoo! homepage with its top ten "Trending Now" stories. He looked to the top at the most popular story: 1 "Where Do We Come From?" / Edmond Kirsch Clearly, Edmond's presentation had inspired people around the globe to research and discuss the topic. Edmond would be so pleased, Langdon thought, but when he clicked the link and saw the first ten headlines, he realized he was wrong. The top ten theories for "where do we come from" were all stories about Creationism and extraterrestrials. Edmond would be horrified. One of Langdon's former student's most infamous rants had occurred at a public forum called Science & Spirituality, where Edmond had become so exasperated by audience questions that he finally threw up his hands and stalked off the stage, shouting: "How is it that intelligent human beings cannot discuss their origins without invoking the name of God and fucking aliens! " Langdon kept scanning down the phone screen until he found a seemingly innocuous CNN Live link titled "What Did Kirsch Discover?" He launched the link and held the phone so Ambra could see it as well. As the video began to play he turned up the volume, and he and Ambra leaned together so they could hear the video over the roar of the helicopter's rotors. A CNN anchor appeared. Langdon had seen her broadcasts many times over the years. "We are joined now by NASA astrobiologist Dr. Griffin Bennett," she said, "who has some ideas regarding Edmond Kirsch's mysterious breaking discovery. Welcome, Dr. Bennett." The guest�a bearded man in wire-rimmed glasses�gave a somber nod. "Thank you. First off, let me say that I knew Edmond personally. I have enormous respect for his intelligence, his creativity, and his commitment to progress and innovation. His assassination has been a terrible blow to the scientific community, and I hope this cowardly murder will serve to fortify the intellectual community to stand united against the dangers of zealotry, superstitious thinking, and those who resort to violence, not facts, to further their beliefs. I sincerely hope the rumors are true that there are people working hard tonight to find a way to bring Edmond's discovery to the public." Langdon shot Ambra a glance. "I think he means us." She nodded. "There are many people who are hoping for that as well, Dr. Bennett," the anchor said. "And can you shed any light on what you think the content of Edmond Kirsch's discovery might be?" "As a space scientist," Dr. Bennett continued, "I feel I should preface my words tonight with a blanket statement ... one that I believe Edmond Kirsch would appreciate." The man turned and looked directly into the camera. "When it comes to the notion of extraterrestrial life," he began, "there exists a blinding array of bad science, conspiracy theory, and outright fantasy. For the record, let me say this: Crop circles are a hoax. Alien autopsy videos are trick photography. No cow has ever been mutilated by an alien. The Roswell saucer was a government weather balloon called Project Mogul. The Great Pyramids were built by Egyptians without alien technology. And most importantly, every extraterrestrial abduction story ever reported is a flat-out lie." "How can you be sure, Doctor?" the anchor asked. "Simple logic," the scientist said, looking annoyed as he turned back to the anchor. "Any life-form advanced enough to travel light-years through interstellar space would have nothing to learn by probing the rectums of farmers in Kansas. Nor would these life-forms need to morph into reptiles and infiltrate governments in order to take over earth. Any life-form with the technology to travel to earth would require no subterfuge or subtlety to dominate us instantaneously." "Well, that's alarming!" the anchor commented with an awkward laugh. "And how does this relate to your thoughts on Mr. Kirsch's discovery?" The man sighed heavily. "It is my strong opinion that Edmond Kirsch was going to announce that he had found definitive proof that life on earth originated in space." Langdon was immediately skeptical, knowing how Kirsch felt about the topic of extraterrestrial life on earth. "Fascinating, what makes you say that?" the anchor pressed. "Life from space is the only rational answer. We already have incontrovertible proof that matter can be exchanged between planets. We have fragments of Mars and Venus along with hundreds of samples from unidentified sources, which would support the idea that life arrived via space rocks in the form of microbes, and eventually evolved into life on earth." The host nodded intently. "But hasn't this theory�microbes arriving from space�been around for decades, with no proof? How do you think a tech genius like Edmond Kirsch could prove a theory like this, which seems more in the realm of astrobiology than computer science." "Well, there's solid logic to it," Dr. Bennett replied. "Top astronomers have warned for decades that humankind's only hope for long-term survival will be to leave this planet. The earth is already halfway through its life cycle, and eventually the sun will expand into a red giant and consume us. That is, if we survive the more imminent threats of a giant asteroid collision or a massive gamma-ray burst. For these reasons, we are already designing outposts on Mars so we can eventually move into deep space in search of a new host planet. Needless to say, this is a massive undertaking, and if we could find a simpler way to ensure our survival, we would implement it immediately." Dr. Bennett paused. "And perhaps there is a simpler way. What if we could somehow package the human genome in tiny capsules and send millions of them into space in hopes one might take root, seeding human life on a distant planet? This technology does not yet exist, but we are discussing it as a viable option for human survival. And if we are considering �seeding life,' then it follows that a more advanced life-form might have considered it as well." Langdon now suspected where Dr. Bennett was going with his theory. "With this in mind," he continued, "I believe Edmond Kirsch may have discovered some kind of alien signature�be it physical, chemical, digital, I don't know �proving that life on earth was seeded from space. I should mention that Edmond and I had quite a debate about this several years ago. He never liked the space-microbe theory because he believed, as many do, that genetic material could never survive the deadly radiation and temperatures that would be encountered in the long journey to earth. Personally, I believe that it would be perfectly feasible to seal these 'seeds of life' in radiation-proof, protective pods and shoot them into space with the intent of populating the cosmos in a kind of technology-assisted panspermia." "Okay," the host said, looking unsettled, "but if someone discovered proof that humans came from a seedpod sent from space, then that means we're not alone in the universe." She paused. "But also, far more incredibly ..." "Yes?" Dr. Bennett smiled for the first time. "It means whoever sent the pods would have to be ... like us ... human !" "Yes, my first conclusion as well." The scientist paused. "Then Edmond set me straight. He pointed out the fallacy in that thinking." This caught the host off guard. "So Edmond's belief was that whoever sent these 'seeds' was not human? How could that be, if the seeds were, so to speak, �recipes' for human propagation?" "Humans are half-baked," the scientist replied, "to use Edmond's exact words." "I'm sorry?" "Edmond said that if this seedpod theory were true, then the recipe that was sent to earth is probably only half-baked at the moment�not yet finished� meaning humans are not the 'final product' but instead just a transitional species evolving toward something else ... something alien." The CNN anchor looked bewildered. "Any advanced life-form, Edmond argued, would not send a recipe for humans any more than they would send a recipe for chimpanzees ." The scientist chuckled. "In fact, Edmond accused me of being a closet Christian�joking that only a religious mind could believe that mankind is the center of the universe. Or that aliens would airmail fully formed �Adam and Eve' DNAinto the cosmos." "Well, Doctor," the host said, clearly uncomfortable with the direction the interview was taking. "It's certainly been enlightening speaking with you. Thank you for your time." The segment ended, and Ambra immediately turned to Langdon. "Robert, if Edmond discovered proof that humans are a half-evolved alien species, then it raises an even bigger issue�what exactly are we evolving into?" "Yes," Langdon said. "And I believe Edmond phrased that issue in a slightly different way�as a question: Where are we going?" Ambra looked startled to have come full circle. "Edmond's second question from tonight's presentation." "Precisely. Where do we come from? Where are we going? Apparently, the NASA scientist we've just watched thinks Edmond looked to the heavens and found answers to both questions." "What do you think, Robert? Is this what Edmond discovered?" Langdon could feel his brow furrow with doubt as he weighed the possibilities. The scientist's theory, while exciting, seemed far too general and otherworldly for the acute thinking of Edmond Kirsch. Edmond liked things simple, clean, and technical. He was a computer scientist. More importantly, Langdon could not imagine how Edmond would prove such a theory. Unearth an ancient seedpod? Detect an alien transmission? Both discoveries would have been instantaneous breakthroughs, but Edmond's discovery had taken time. Edmond said he had been working on it for months. "Obviously, I don't know," Langdon told Ambra, "but my gut tells me Edmond's discovery has nothing to do with extraterrestrial life. I really believe he discovered something else entirely." Ambra looked surprised, and then intrigued. "I guess there's only one way to find out." She motioned out the window. In front of them shone the glimmering spires of Sagrada Familia. CHAPTER 64 bishop valdespino stole another quick glance at Julian, who was still staring blankly out the window of the Opel sedan as it sped along Highway M-505. What is he thinking? Valdespino wondered. The prince had been silent for nearly thirty minutes, barely moving except for the occasional reflexive reach into his pocket for his phone, only to realize that he had locked it in his wall safe. I need to keep him in the dark, Valdespino thought, just a bit longer. In the front seat, the acolyte from the cathedral was still driving in the direction of Casita del Principe, although Valdespino soon would need to inform him that the prince's retreat was not their destination at all. Julian turned suddenly from the window, tapping the acolyte on the shoulder. "Please turn on the radio," he said. "I'd like to hear the news." Before the young man could comply, Valdespino leaned forward and placed a firm hand on the boy's shoulder. "Let's just sit quietly, shall we?" Julian turned to the bishop, clearly displeased at having been overridden. "I'm sorry," Valdespino said at once, sensing a growing distrust in the prince's eyes. "It's late. All that chatter. I prefer silent reflection." "I've been doing some reflecting," Julian said, his voice sharp, "and I'd like to know what's going on in my country. We've entirely isolated ourselves tonight, and I'm starting to wonder if it was a good idea." "It is a good idea," Valdespino assured him, "and I appreciate the trust you've shown me." He removed his hand from the acolyte's shoulder and motioned to the radio. "Please turn on the news. Perhaps Radio Maria Espana?" Valdespino hoped the worldwide Catholic station would be gentler and more tactful than most media outlets had been about tonight's troubling developments. When the newscaster's voice came over the cheap car speakers, he was discussing Edmond Kirsch's presentation and assassination. Every station in the world is talking about this tonight. Valdespino just hoped his own name would not come up as part of the broadcast. Fortunately, the topic at the moment appeared to be the dangers of the antireligious message preached by Kirsch, especially the threat posed by his influence on the youth of Spain. As an example, the station began rebroadcasting a lecture Kirsch had delivered recently at the University of Barcelona. "Many of us are afraid to call ourselves atheists," Kirsch said calmly to the assembled students. "And yet atheism is not a philosophy, nor is atheism a view of the world. Atheism is simply an admission of the obvious." Several students clapped in agreement. "The term �atheist,'" Kirsch continued, "should not even exist. No one ever needs to identify himself as a �nonastrologer' or a �nonalchemist.' We do not have words for people who doubt that Elvis is still alive, or for people who doubt that aliens traverse the galaxy only to molest cattle. Atheism is nothing more than the noises reasonable people make in the presence of unjustified religious beliefs." A growing number of students clapped their approval. "That definition is not mine, by the way," Kirsch told them. "Those words belong to neuroscientist Sam Harris. And if you have not already done so, you must read his book Letter to a Christian Nation." Valdespino frowned, recalling the stir caused by Harris's book, Carta a una Nacion Cristiana, which, while written for Americans, had reverberated across Spain. "By a show of hands," Kirsch continued, "how many of you believe in any of the following ancient gods: Apollo? Zeus? Vulcan?" He paused, and then laughed. "Not a single one of you? Okay, so it appears we are all atheists with respect to those gods." He paused. "I simply choose to go one god further." The crowd clapped louder still. "My friends, I am not saying I know for a fact that there is no God. All I am saying is that if there is a divine force behind the universe, it is laughing hysterically at the religions we've created in an attempt to define it." Everyone laughed. Valdespino was now pleased that the prince had asked to listen to the radio. Julian needs to hear this. Kirsch's devilishly seductive charm was proof that the enemies of Christ were no longer sitting idly by, but rather were actively trying to pull souls away from God. "I'm an American," Kirsch continued, "and I feel profoundly fortunate to have been born in one of the most technologically advanced and intellectually progressive countries on earth. And so I found it deeply disturbing when a recent poll revealed that one half of my countrymen believe quite literally that Adam and Eve existed�that an all-powerful God created two fully formed human beings who single-handedly populated the entire planet, generating all the diverse races, with none of the inherent problems of inbreeding." More laughter. "In Kentucky," he continued, "church pastor Peter LaRuffa publicly declared: �If somewhere within the Bible, I found a passage that said �two plus two is five/ I would believe it and accept it as true/" Still more laughter. "I agree, it's easy to laugh, but I assure you, these beliefs are far more terrifying than they are funny. Many of the people who espouse them are bright, educated professionals�doctors, lawyers, teachers, and in some cases, people who aspire to the highest offices in the land. I once heard U.S. congressman Paul Broun say, �Evolution and the Big Bang are lies straight from the pit of hell. I believe the earth is about nine thousand years old, and it was created in six days as we know them/" Kirsch paused. "Even more troubling, Congressman Broun sits on the House Science, Space, and Technology Committee, and when questioned about the existence of a fossil record spanning millions of years, his response was �Fossils were placed there by God to test our faith/" Kirsch's voice grew suddenly quiet and somber. "To permit ignorance is to empower it. To do nothing as our leaders proclaim absurdities is a crime of complacency. As is letting our schools and churches teach outright untmths to our children. The time for action has come. Not until we purge our species of superstitious thinking can we embrace all that our minds have to offer." He paused and a hush fell over the crowd. "I love humankind. I believe our minds and our species have limitless potential. I believe we are on the brink of an enlightened new era, a world where religion finally departs ... and science reigns." The crowd erupted with wild applause. "For heaven's sake," Valdespino snapped, shaking his head in disgust. "Turn it off." The acolyte obeyed, and the three men drove on in silence. Thirty miles away, Monica Martin was standing opposite a breathless Suresh Bhalla, who had just dashed in and handed her a cell phone. "Long story," Suresh gasped, "but you need to read this text that Bishop Valdespino received." "Hold on." Martin almost dropped the device. "This is the bishop's phone?! How the hell did you�" "Don't ask. Just read." Alarmed, Martin directed her eyes to the phone and began reading the text on its screen. Within seconds, she felt herself blanch. "My God, Bishop Valdespino is ..." "Dangerous," Suresh said. "But... this is impossible! Who is this person who texted the bishop?!" "Shielded number," Suresh said. "I'm working on identifying it." "And why wouldn't Valdespino delete this message?" "No idea," Suresh said flatly. "Careless? Arrogant? I'll try to undelete any other texts, and also see if I can identify who Valdespino is texting with, but I wanted to give you this news on Valdespino right away; you'll have to make a statement on it." "No, I won't!" Martin said, still reeling. "The palace is not going public with this information!" "No, but someone else will very soon." Suresh quickly explained that the motive for searching Valdespino's phone had been a direct e-mail tip from monte@iglesia.org�the informant who was feeding news to ConspiracyNet� and if this person acted true to form, the bishop's text would not remain private for long. Martin closed her eyes, trying to picture the world's reaction to incontrovertible proof that a Catholic bishop with very close ties to the king of Spain was directly involved in tonight's treachery and murder. "Suresh," Martin whispered, slowly opening her eyes. "I need you to figure out who this �Monte' informant is. Can you do that for me?" "I can try." He did not sound hopeful. "Thanks." Martin handed the bishop's phone back to him and hurried to the door. "And send me a screenshot of that text!" "Where are you going?" Suresh called. Monica Martin did not answer. CHAPTER 65 la sagrada familia� the Basilica of the Holy Family�occupies an entire city block in central Barcelona. Despite its massive footprint, the church seems to hover almost weightlessly above the earth, a delicate cluster of airy spires that ascend effortlessly into the Spanish sky. Intricate and porous, the towers have varying heights, giving the shrine the air of a whimsical sand castle erected by mischievous giants. Once completed, the tallest of the eighteen pinnacles will climb a dizzying and unprecedented 560 feet�higher than the Washington Monument�making Sagrada Familia the tallest church in the world, eclipsing the Vatican's own St. Peter's Basilica by more than a hundred feet. The body of the church is sheltered by three massive facades. To the east, the colorful Nativity facade climbs like a hanging garden, sprouting polychrome plants, animals, fruits, and people. In stark contrast, the Passion facade to the west is an austere skeleton of harsh stone, hewn to resemble sinews and bone. To the south, the Glory facade twists upward in a chaotic clutter of demons, idols, sins, and vices, eventually giving way to loftier symbols of ascension, virtue, and paradise. Completing the perimeter are countless smaller facades, buttresses, and towers, most of them sheathed in a mud-like material, giving the effect that the lower half of the building is either melting or has been extruded from the earth. According to one prominent critic, Sagrada Familia's lower half resembles "a rotting tree trunk from which had sprouted a family of intricate mushroom spires." In addition to adorning his church with traditional religious iconography, Gaudi included countless startling features that reflected his reverence for nature �turtles supporting columns, trees sprouting from facades, and even giant stone snails and frogs scaling the outside of the building. Despite its outlandish exterior, the true surprise of Sagrada Familia is glimpsed only after stepping through its doorways. Once inside the main sanctuary, visitors invariably stand slack-jawed as their eyes climb the slanting and twisting tree-trunk columns up two hundred feet to a series of hovering vaults, where psychedelic collages of geometric shapes hover like a crystalline canopy in the tree branches. The creation of a "columned forest," Gaudi claimed, was to encourage the mind to return to thoughts of the earliest spiritual seekers, for whom the forest had served as God's cathedral. Not surprisingly, Gaudi's colossal Art Nouveau opus is both passionately adored and cynically scorned. Hailed by some as "sensual, spiritual, and organic," it is derided by others as "vulgar, pretentious, and profane." Author James Michener described it as "one of the strangest-looking serious buildings in the world," and Architectural Review called it "Gaudi's sacred monster." If its aesthetics are strange, its finances are even stranger. Funded entirely by private donations, Sagrada Familia receives no financial support whatsoever from the Vatican or the world Catholic leadership. Despite periods of near bankruptcy and work stoppages, the church exhibits an almost Darwinian will to survive, having tenaciously endured the death of its architect, a violent civil war, terrorist attacks by Catalan anarchists, and even the drilling of a subway tunnel nearby that threatened to destabilize the very ground on which it sits. In the face of incredible adversity, Sagrada Familia still stands, and continues to grow. Over the past decade, the church's fortunes have improved considerably, its coffers supplemented by ticket sales to more than four million visitors a year who pay handsomely to tour the partially completed structure. Now, having announced a target completion date of 2026�the centenary of Gaudi's death� Sagrada Familia seems to be infused with a fresh vigor, its spires climbing heavenward with a renewed urgency and hope. Father Joaquim Bena�Sagrada Familia's oldest priest and presiding clergyman�was a jovial eighty-year-old with round glasses on a round face that was always smiling atop his tiny robe-draped body. Bena's dream was to live long enough to see the completion of this glorious shrine. Tonight, however, inside his clerical office, Father Bena was not smiling. He had stayed late on church business, but had ended up riveted to his computer, entirely caught up in the disturbing drama unfolding in Bilbao. Edmond Kirsch was assassinated. Over the last three months, Bena had forged a delicate and unlikely friendship with Kirsch. The outspoken atheist had stunned Bena by approaching him personally with an offer to make a huge donation to the church. The amount was unprecedented and would have an enormous positive impact. Kirsch's offer makes no sense, Bena had thought, suspecting a catch. Is it a publicity stunt? Perhaps he wants influence over the construction? In return for his donation, the renowned futurist had made only one request. Bena had listened, uncertain. That's all he wants? "This is a personal matter for me," Kirsch had said. "And I'm hoping you'll be willing to honor my request." Bena was a trusting man, and yet in that moment he sensed he was dancing with the devil. Bena found himself searching Kirsch's eyes for some ulterior motive. And then he saw it. Behind Kirsch's carefree charm there burned a weary desperation, his sunken eyes and thin body reminding Bena of his days in seminary working as a hospice counselor. Edmond Kirsch is ill. Bena wondered if the man was dying, and if this donation might be a sudden attempt to make amends with the God whom he had always scorned. The most self-righteous in life become the most fearful in death. Bena thought about the earliest Christian evangelist�Saint John�who had dedicated his life to encouraging nonbelievers to experience the glory of Jesus Christ. It seemed that if a nonbeliever like Kirsch wanted to participate in the creation of a shrine to Jesus, then denying him that connection would be both unchristian and cruel. In addition, there was the matter of Bena's professional obligation to help raise funds for the church, and he could not imagine informing his colleagues that Kirsch's giant gift had been rejected because of the man's history of outspoken atheism. In the end, Bena accepted Kirsch's terms, and the men had shaken hands warmly. That was three months ago. Tonight, Bena had watched Kirsch's presentation at the Guggenheim, first feeling troubled by its antireligious tone, then intrigued by Kirsch's references to a mysterious discovery, and ultimately horrified to see Edmond Kirsch gunned down. In the aftermath, Bena had been unable to leave his computer, riveted by what was quickly becoming a dizzying kaleidoscope of competing conspiracy theories. Feeling overwhelmed, Bena now sat quietly in the cavernous sanctuary, alone in Gaudi's "forest" of pillars. The mystical woods, however, did little to calm his racing mind. What did Kirsch discover? Who wanted him dead? Father Bena closed his eyes and tried to clear his thoughts, but the questions kept recurring. Where do we come from? Where are we going? "We come from God!" Bena declared aloud. "And we go to God!" As he spoke, he felt the words resonate in his chest with such force that the entire sanctuary seemed to vibrate. Suddenly a bright shaft of light pierced the stained-glass window above the Passion facade and streamed down into the basilica. Awestruck, Father Bena stood up and staggered toward the window, the entire church now thundering as the beam of celestial light descended along the colored glass. When he burst out of the church's main doors, Bena found himself assaulted by a deafening windstorm. Above him to the left, a massive helicopter was descending out of the sky, its searchlight strafing the front of the church. Bena watched in disbelief as the aircraft touched down inside the perimeter of the construction fences on the northwestern corner of the compound and powered down. As the wind and noise subsided, Father Bena stood in the main doorway of Sagrada Familia and watched as four figures descended from the craft and hurried toward him. The two in front were instantly recognizable from tonight's broadcast�one was the future queen of Spain, and the other was Professor Robert Langdon. They were tailed by two strapping men in monogrammed blazers. From the look of things, Langdon had not kidnapped Ambra Vidal after all. As the American professor approached, Ms. Vidal appeared to be by his side entirely by her own choice. "Father!" the woman called with a friendly wave. "Please forgive our noisy intrusion into this sacred space. We need to speak to you right away. It's very important." Bena opened his mouth to reply but could only nod mutely as the unlikely group arrived before him. "Our apologies, Father," said Robert Langdon with a disarming smile. "I know this must all seem very strange. Do you know who we are?" "Of course," he managed, "but I thought..." "Bad information," Ambra said. "Everything is fine, I assure you." Just then, two security guards stationed outside the perimeter fence raced in through the security turnstiles, understandably alarmed by the helicopter's arrival. The guards spotted Bena and dashed toward him. Instantly, the two men in monogrammed blazers spun and faced them, extending their palms in the universal symbol for "halt." The guards stopped dead in their tracks, startled, looking to Bena for guidance. ";Tot esta be!" Bena shouted in Catalan. "Tornin al seu Hoc" All is well! Return to your post. The guards squinted up at the unlikely assembly, looking uncertain. "Son els metis convidats," Bena declared, firmly now. They are my guests. "Confio en la seva discrecio." I will rely on your discretion. The bewildered guards retreated through the security turnstile to resume their patrol of the perimeter. "Thank you," Ambra said. "I appreciate that." "I am Father Joaquim Bena," he said. "Please tell me what this is about." Robert Langdon stepped forward and shook Bena's hand. "Father Bena, we are looking for a rare book owned by the scientist Edmond Kirsch." Langdon produced an elegant note card and handed it to him. "This card claims the book is on loan to this church." Though somewhat dazed by the group's dramatic arrival, Bena recognized the ivory card at once. An exact copy of this card accompanied the book that Kirsch had given him a few weeks ago. The Complete Works of William Blake. The stipulation of Edmond's large donation to Sagrada Familia had been that Blake's book be placed on display in the basilica crypt. A strange request, but a small price to pay. Kirsch's one additional request�outlined on the back of the linen card�was that the book always remain propped open to page 163. CHAPTER 66 five miles to the northwest of Sagrada Familia, Admiral Avila gazed through the windshield of the Uber at the broad expanse of city lights, which glittered against the blackness of the Balearic Sea beyond. Barcelona at last, the old naval officer thought, pulling out his phone and calling the Regent, as promised. The Regent answered on the first ring. "Admiral Avila. Where are you?" "Minutes outside the city." "Your arrival is well timed. I have just received troubling news." "Tell me." "You have successfully severed the head of the snake. However, just as we feared, the long tail is still writhing dangerously." "How can I be of service?" Avila asked. When the Regent shared his desires, Avila was surprised. He had not imagined that the night would entail any more loss of life, but he was not about to question the Regent. I am no more than a foot soldier, he reminded himself. "This mission will be dangerous," the Regent said. "If you are caught, show the authorities the symbol on your palm. You will be freed shortly. We have influence everywhere." "I don't intend to be caught," Avila said, glancing at his tattoo. "Good," the Regent said in an eerily lifeless tone. "If all goes according to plan, soon they will both be dead, and all of this will be over." The connection was broken. In the sudden silence, Avila raised his eyes to the brightest point on the horizon�a hideous cluster of deformed spires ablaze with construction lights. Sagrada Familia, he thought, repulsed by the whimsical silhouette. A shrine to all that is wrong with our faith. Barcelona's celebrated church, Avila believed, was a monument to weakness and moral collapse�a surrender to liberal Catholicism, brazenly twisting and distorting thousands of years of faith into a warped hybrid of nature worship, pseudoscience, and Gnostic heresy. There are giant lizards crawling up a church of Christ! The collapse of tradition in the world terrified Avila, but he felt buoyed by the appearance of a new group of world leaders who apparently shared his fears and were doing whatever it took to restore tradition. Avila's own devotion to the Palmarian Church, and especially to Pope Innocent XIV, had given him a new reason to live, helping him see his own tragedy through an entirely new lens. My wife and child were casualties of war, Avila thought, a war waged by the forces of evil against God, against tradition. Forgiveness is not the only road to salvation. Five nights ago, Avila had been asleep in his modest apartment when he was awoken by the loud ping of an arriving text message on his cell phone. "It's midnight," he grumbled, hazily squinting at the screen to find out who had contacted him at this hour. Numero oculto Avila rubbed his eyes and read the incoming message. Compruebe su saldo bancario Check my bank balance? Avila frowned, now suspecting some kind of telemarketing scam. Annoyed, he got out of bed and walked to the kitchen to get a drink of water. As he stood at the sink, he glanced over at his laptop, knowing he would probably not get back to sleep until he took a look. He logged onto his bank's website, fully anticipating seeing his usual, pitifully small balance�the remains of his military pension. However, when his account information appeared, he leaped to his feet so suddenly that he knocked over a chair. But that's impossible! He closed his eyes and then looked again. Then he refreshed the screen. The number remained. He fumbled with the mouse, scrolling to his account activity, and was stunned to see that an anonymous deposit of a hundred thousand euros had been wired into his account an hour earlier. The source was numbered and untraceable. Who would do this?! The sharp buzzing of his cell phone made Avila's heart beat faster. He grabbed his phone and looked at his caller ID. Numero oculto Avila stared at the phone and then seized it. A soft voice spoke to him in pure Castilian Spanish. "Good evening, Admiral. I trust you have seen the gift we sent you?" "I ... have," he stammered. "Who are you?" "You may call me the Regent," the voice replied. "I represent your brethren, the members of the church that you have faithfully attended for the past two years. Your skills and loyalty have not gone unnoticed, Admiral. We would now like to give you the opportunity to serve a higher purpose. His Holiness has proposed for you a series of missions ... tasks sent to you by God." Avila was now fully awake, his palms sweating. "The money we gave you is an advance on your first mission," the voice continued. "If you choose to carry out the mission, consider it an opportunity to prove yourself worthy of taking a place within our highest ranks." He paused. "There exists a powerful hierarchy in our church that is invisible to the world. We believe you would be an asset at the top of our organization." Although excited by the prospect of advancement, Avila felt wary. "What is the mission? And what if I choose not to carry it out?" "You will not be judged in any way, and you may keep the money in return for your secrecy. Does that sound reasonable?" "It sounds quite generous." "We like you. We want to help you. And out of fairness to you, I want to warn you that the pope's mission is a difficult one." He paused. "It may involve violence." Avila's body went rigid. Violence? "Admiral, the forces of evil are growing stronger every day. God is at war, and wars entail casualties." Avila flashed on the horror of the bomb that had killed his family. Shivering, he banished the dark memories. "I'm sorry, I don't know if I can accept a violent mission�" "The pope handpicked you, Admiral," the Regent whispered. "The man you will target in this mission ... is the man who murdered your family." CHAPTER 67 located on the ground floor of Madrid's Royal Palace, the armory is an elegantly vaulted chamber whose high crimson walls are adorned with magnificent tapestries depicting famous battles in Spain's history. Encircling the room is a priceless collection of more than a hundred suits of handcrafted armor, including the battle garb and "tools" of many past kings. Seven life-size horse mannequins stand in the center of the room, posed in full battle gear. This is where they decide to keep me prisoner? Garza wondered, looking out at the implements of war that surrounded him. Admittedly, the armory was one of the most secure rooms in the palace, but Garza suspected his captors had chosen this elegant holding cell in hopes of intimidating him. This is the very room in which I was hired. Nearly two decades ago, Garza had been ushered into this imposing chamber, where he had been interviewed, cross-examined, and interrogated before finally being offered the job of head of the Royal Guard. Now Garza's own agents had arrested him. I'm being charged with plotting an assassination? And for framing the bishop? The logic behind the allegations was so twisted that Garza couldn't begin to untangle it. When it came to the Royal Guard, Garza was the highest-ranking official in the palace, meaning the order to arrest him could have come from only one man ... Prince Julian himself. Valdespino poisoned the prince's mind against me, Garza realized. The bishop had always been a political survivor, and tonight he was apparently desperate enough to attempt this audacious media stunt�a bold ploy to clear his own reputation by smearing Garza's. And now they've locked me in the armory so I can't speak for myself. If Julian and Valdespino had joined forces, Garza knew he was lost, entirely outmaneuvered. At this point, the only person on earth with power enough to help Garza was an old man who was living out his final days in a hospital bed in his private residence at Palacio de la Zarzuela. The king of Spain. Then again, Garza realized, the king will never help me if doing so means crossing Bishop Valdespino or his own son. He could hear the crowds outside chanting louder now, and it sounded like things might take a violent turn. When Garza realized what they were chanting, he couldn't believe his ears. "Where does Spain come from?!" they shouted. "Where is Spain going?!" The protesters, it appeared, had seized upon Kirsch's two provocative questions as an opportunity to rant about the political future of Spain's monarchy. Where do we come from? Where are we going? Condemning the oppression of the past, Spain's younger generation was constantly calling for faster change�urging their country to "join the civilized world" as a full democracy and to abolish its monarchy. France, Germany, Russia, Austria, Poland, and more than fifty other countries had abandoned their crowns in the last century. Even in England there was a push for a referendum on ending the monarchy after the current queen died. Tonight, unfortunately, Madrid's Royal Palace was in a state of disarray, so it was not surprising to hear this age-old battle cry being raised again. Just what Prince Julian needs, Garza thought, as he prepares for ascension to the throne. The door at the far end of the armory suddenly clicked open and one of Garza's Guardia agents peered in. Garza shouted to him, "I want an attorney!" "And I want a statement for the press," the familiar voice of Monica Martin shouted back as the palace's PR coordinator manuevered around the guard and marched into the room. "Commander Garza, why did you collude with the killers of Edmond Kirsch?" Garza stared at her in disbelief. Has everyone gone mad? "We know you framed Bishop Valdespino!" Martin declared, striding toward him. "And the palace wants to publish your confession right now!" The commander had no reply. Halfway across the room, Martin spun around abruptly, glaring back at the young guard in the doorway. "I said a private confession!" The guard looked uncertain as he stepped back and closed the door. Martin wheeled back toward Garza and stormed the rest of the way across the floor. "I want a confession now!" she bellowed, her voice echoing off the vaulted ceiling as she arrived directly in front of him.
